1,"Galanz 6.5 Cu ft One Door Refrigerator, with Water Dispenser, Stainless Steel Look, Estar, New",[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is a lot bigger then I expected. I love the water dispenser and how easy it is to fill. It makes next to no noise unless your head is right by it.

2,"Galanz 6.5 Cu ft One Door Refrigerator, with Water Dispenser, Stainless Steel Look, Estar, New","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First of all I love the steel look to it , it makes it looks very nice and sleek. It did come with a dent on the top that does not affect how it works but disappointed on how it may have been handled by the courier which is not the company's fault . Overall it's a great fridge it's very compact and can fit anywhere . It's a great size with various shelves and a decent size freezer . The water dispenser works great and is easy to clean or refill and has a lock/unlock switch .",5,1/9/2025,4.777777777777778

4,"Galanz 6.5 Cu ft One Door Refrigerator, with Water Dispenser, Stainless Steel Look, Estar, New","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the Galanz 6.5 Cu. ft One Door Refrigerator with a water dispenser and stainless steel look from Influenster in exchange for an honest review, and I'm genuinely impressed with its design and functionality.

The compact size is perfect for smaller spaces like dorm rooms, offices, or game rooms, fitting neatly without taking up too much room. Despite its size, it offers excellent storage capacity with thoughtful organizational features, including three adjustable glass shelves, three removable door bins, a transparent crisper drawer, and even a separate freezer compartment for frozen food, ice cream.

One of the standout features is the built-in 2.5-liter manual-fill water dispenser. I love that it doesn't require any water pipe connection, making it super convenient and easy to use. The exterior design is sleek and modern, with a flat door panel and stainless steel finish that adds a touch of elegance to any room.

Another big plus is its energy efficiency—it's EStar certified, meaning it consumes less power while keeping everything perfectly chilled. It's also impressively quiet, which makes it ideal for bedrooms or shared spaces where noise could be disruptive. The adjustable thermostat and legs make it easy to maintain the perfect temperature and ensure stability on uneven surfaces.

Overall, this refrigerator is the perfect blend of style, functionality, and convenience. If you're looking for a compact, energy-efficient fridge with a modern design and useful features like a water dispenser, this is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!",5,1/24/2025,4.777777777777778

One Door Refrigerator is an excellent choice for individuals or small households looking for a compact, efficient, and feature-packed fridge. The water dispenser adds a touch of convenience, and its energy efficiency makes it a cost-effective option in the long run. However, if you require a large freezer or larger storage capacity, you might want to explore other options. Overall, it's a great buy for its price and purpose.",5,1/22/2025,4.777777777777778

7,"Galanz 6.5 Cu ft One Door Refrigerator, with Water Dispenser, Stainless Steel Look, Estar, New","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] it's a bit smaller than a usual fridge but it can still hold a lot! I love the water dispenser in the front, it's not taking too much space! I didn't expect there to be a freezer & although it's a bit small, it's still very nice & works well!",4,1/21/2025,4.777777777777778
8,"Galanz 6.5 Cu ft One Door Refrigerator, with Water Dispenser, Stainless Steel Look, Estar, New","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a decent size fridge that is 4' 1/2"" from ground to top.  It is quiet and can't hear hardly any sound.  It has a dial temperature control that makes it easy to set the temp you want.  Has a little freezer section on the top part.  Shelves are wide enough to hold 12 pack of soda, little harder to have 12 pack lengthwise as it sticks out into the door.  Only shelf that goes between door shelves will work to put 12 pack lengthwise. It has a plastic container hooked to the door to fill with water to be able to use the despenser in front of the door.  It's kind of a hassle to have to fill the water container.  This is a great as an extra fridge in my garage.",4,1/31/2025,4.777777777777778
9,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel",This fridge was the best purchase ever we use it for our daughter's IV hydration. We also bought it to keep all our seltzers and liquor that needs to be cold in the door. It's a multi used refrigerator at a fraction of the cost that you would pay to get a big one I feel like this is 6.2 ft.³ is amazing size the college ones were too small and I couldn't afford a big regular size fridge to me. It was the best fridge option for us.,5,12/24/2024,4.0
10,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","We bought this for our  loft area and it great addition it nice to not have run down stairs  to get water in the middle of the night.

11,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel",Replaced RV refrigerator with this one.  Love the water dispenser.  The fingerprintless finish on the door is great!  Interior layout makes for organization.  Price was excellent.  Delivery was perfect!  So glad you had this model that fit in my space!!!,5,9/5/2024,4.0
12,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","I looked around the internet for a replacement for my 3.3 RCA Mini fridge and found this small refrigerator for about the same price. I am glad I was able to upgrade so much. It works very well and looks great too! I like the clear door for the freezer. The door shelves are wider than the picture shows. It is nice to have a light in the refrigerator, most mini fridge's don't have a light. The freezer freezes ice cubes very fast unlike most mini refrigerator's. It is only a little wider than my last mini refrigerator so it fits in the same place as the last one did. I would buy this refrigerator now if I was you before it goes out of stock or the price goes up.",5,9/7/2024,4.0
13,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","So far so good. It has back wheels so you can remove the box and easily move it around the house. The front feet keep it in place once you put it where you want. 

Got cold very quickly. Quiet and attractive. I recommend it. Especially if you catch a great sale like I did.",5,12/29/2024,4.0
14,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","I bought this primarily for the water dispenser to have near my desk but I also have kept yogurt in it.  I've had it for several months and it currently works great.  For the first month or so, it would leak a little bit of water into the tray beneath the dispenser between uses but it eventually stopped on its own.  The inside stays very cold and I've turned the temperature dial most of the way down now.  It was a good purchase for me and helps me remember to drink more water.",4,1/30/2025,4.0
15,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel",worked well untill we started to use the freezer which caused it to freeze over with thick ice which would then melt all over the hardwood floor. drip pan wasnt even fully attached to the bottom of the unit..and freezer door just fell off as i was taking a few pitures for the review...,2,9/16/2024,4.0
16,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel",Arrived damaged. Dent in door by hinge from hinge being shoved into door. Hinge was offset and door would absolutely not close. Still trying to figure a work around since I have limited mobility to return heavy item. Seems look a great product if it worked correctly and was I damaged,2,1/3/2025,4.0
17,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","Received this scratched and dented.  I immediately contact Walmart customer service.  They told me they'd ""figure out a solution, such as a partial credit"" and get back to me.  Immediately I received an email that they were going to do nothing to compensate me.  Mind you, I purchased this and had it shipped because I don't own a vehicle that would be big enough to transport this.  Overall, IF it works it looks nice other than the damages to it.  The box obviously had been opened before, which I noticed immediately.  I tried to stop the Fedex driver to refuse it and he was already gone.",1,9/26/2024,4.0
18,"FarberwareHumidity Controlled Crisper Refrigerator, Stainless Steel","The refrigerator is great. When it was delivered it had many dents in it. The freezer door is cracked. The seal doesn't seal correctly because of the dents. Door kept falling off due to damages. I have emailed with no response as of yet. I am unable to return it to the store due to Its too big for me to handle. I explained that in the email as well, I requested to send me a freezer door and still no response. Happy with the item but very disappointed in the damages to it along with being very disappointed with their customer service!",1,12/12/2024,4.0

54,"Frigidaire 7.5 Cu. ft. Refrigerator, Platinum Series, Standard Door Style - Stainless Look","The Fridge arrived in good shape with no damage to the box or to the fridge itself.  I plugged it in and it started cooling down right away. Within about and hour it was freezing water and chilling my Gatorade nicely.  The size is just what I needed and the price was shockingly low ($199 pre tax) and free shipping!  We have only had it for 2 days but it seems to be a great fridge except for 2 oddities.  The outside walls of the fridge are literally hot.  The top, the back and front are not hot at all, just the sides.  This is the first refrigerator I ever owned that was hot to the touch.  It runs on a heat pump, so it is removing heat from the interior and shedding it to the exterior, apparently through the sides.  Very odd.  I hope this is normal and it won't catch fire some day.",4,5/30/2024,4.1
55,"Frigidaire 7.5 Cu. ft. Refrigerator, Platinum Series, Standard Door Style - Stainless Look","Ok so this was shipped via FedEx...
The date and times changed a few times for when it was going to be delivered and if you have had enough deliveries, you know something is up...
Being handicapped I basically had everyone in our 15 unit building watching out for my delivery, including all the maintenance guys that were doing work, because I knew the later it was getting, the chances of me getting it delivered per my instructions were slim and none.
I made my way outside to wait and sure enough I hear a truck speeding down the street, he sees me and slams on his brakes, seems he was going to just keep on going and then I would get a lovely note saying ""unable to deliver"" or ""no one home"" (I am sure we have all had this from one service or another).
I hold the door and say the elevator is right there, go to my floor and its about 10 feet (he was not thrilled to say the least that I saw him lol).
I asked him to bring it right inside the door, he said he can't, I said I can not move it, nor can I get out of my door since you dropped it where I cant get in or out. 
After huffing and puffing he asked where I wanted it and I said right there against the wall out of the way (4 feet away). He brings it in and then starts to take off after turning it for some weird reason. 
I walk to the side and see a major tear in the box like 24"" and could put my hand in it! (every side had damage, for freaks sake!).  I said WAIT!  this could be damaged, he said no there is padding all around, I said dude!, I feel the refrigerator and then he bolted, WOW.
We ended up, the next day, getting it open and shocked and grateful there wasn't a dent or scratch or anything on the outside!  We put it together, no biggie, until we saw the tray underneath, it was cracked!!
Contacted Walmart and they wanted me to return the whole thing!  Like NO! I said, there is nothing wrong except the tray underneath is broken, we just need this part replaced.  
The CS rep gave me Frigidaire's contact info and they were NOT any help, telling me I have to contact someone else, like seriously IT'S JUST A TRAY, REPLACE IT for Pete's sake!
Nope...

Submitted and waited for a reply.  I had to contact them to receive updates and information, 7 phone calls, and 10 plus emails. Was told to dispose of the unit(I was responsible for disposal, I had to pay someone to remove the refrigerant from the unit to dispose).  On June 29th I received an email stating they would cover under warranty,  Refund check would take 7 to 10 business days.

The box was also damaged but the FedEx driver had already left so we could not refuse delivery. We hoped that the styrofoam had protected the frig inside, but this is not the case. When you see the damage to the refrigerator it looks like it fell very far against a very hard edge, or it was picked up incorrectly by a forklift, or that it was crashed into! We truly wonder if this was a previous return as there was no manual inside. I don't even understand why FedEx accepted the package for delivery, unless it was their handling that did all the damage? Either way, shame on FedEx. We are so frustrated; during the return process, we were only offered a refund not an exchange. Also, WE are supposed to take it for return to a nearby store! We did not pick it up at a store, it was delivered! Why is the onus on us to return it to the store? This was supposed to be a gift for our adult daughter! We are senior citizens; how are we supposed to lift this up and fit it into our vehicle?

This is similar to many other customer reviews so it's a known problem to Walmart and they have failed to address it. These units should be advertised as scratch and dent because that's what they are. Very misleading by Walmart and they have failed to address these issues through quality control measures because they're too big, too greedy, and likely don't really care one way or the other.

The cooling plate was about 2.5 x 2.5 inches surrounded by plastic in the old version. Now the cooling area is spread over a metal interior covering the rear half inside. Result is more distributed cooling without freezing condensation from having a small metal plate and lots of water pooling inside. Now cooling is effective,  without condensation or pooling of water inside. Haven't had it long to comment on how long it may last, but I can testify electronics are a major improvement over the previous model, even though the model numbers are the same except for the color designator in the model number.",5,8/29/2024,4.0
88,"Frigidaire, Retro 10L, 15-Can Mini Personal Fridge Cooler, EFMIS183, Stainless Steel","While it says it holds 15 cans, there is a method required and all internal plastics (door and the shelf) have to be removed. With those things remaining, the best I could do was 10 cans. There was a bit of leftover space, but the fridge dimensions were wider than two cans, but narrower than three. Spacing the cans in a way that I could use a void to create room for two more cans, I was able to shoehorn in 10 total. That said, the directions show a ""plan"" for putting in 15 cans. And it works, though you have to keep your parts somewhere where you won't lose them.

So let's go through a few things:
- It's cheap. It's 100 percent plastic (only the door facing is ""stainless steel"" and it's not really ""stainless steel""). So cheap is good, but you get what you pay for.
- It comes with both a 120v plug and a car plug. That's cool.
- It has a handle to lift at the top. Also cool.
- It's light mostly because it's made of plastic, but it is good that it's light.
- There is no temperature variation. There is only one control: On/Off.
- It's not silent, but it is relatively quiet. It's not a distracting level of white noise (fan).

So all in all, it's a decent value for traveling with cool drinks on a road trip, or having a space in the office where you can keep your drinks out of the company fridge that co-worker Joe likes to pilfer.

But there is one flag here, from the Use %26 Care manual, and I quote:

90,"Frigidaire, Retro 10L, 15-Can Mini Personal Fridge Cooler, EFMIS183, Stainless Steel","Bought this mini fridge for a short two day road trip to a home belonging to my in-laws that is up for sale. All the electric appliances are unplugged there, and I needed a way to keep 2-3 bottles of water and some snacks for our 2 YO son cold. We have coolers, but large ones take up too much space in the SUV, and small ones compromise interior space with ice. I plugged the refrigerator into our house power (110V) the night before the road trip to pre-chill it. There are no temperature settings, just On/Off switch. I put in a wireless thermometer to monitor the fridge's temp. In the morning, it read 45 degrees F. We keep our home fridge at 34 F (for reference). I was disappointed with the mini fridge's performance but decided to take it anyway. I unplugged the fridge, moved it into our SUV, and plugged it into 12V DC. I added some COLD bottles of water and snacks, and we shortly departed. As we drove, I watched the fridge's interior temp climb from 50 F to 68 F.  The best it could do was chill to just below 70 F for the duration of the seven hour drive. The SUV's AC was kept between 70-73 F. When we arrived at our destination, I plugged the fridge in at the house to see if 110V AC would get the temp down. It took over 12 hours to get to 50 F.  For three days, we used the fridge to ""cool"" some bottles of water, but it couldn't get anything COLD! On the drive home, I plugged it into the SUV's 110V inverter. Again, the fridge could not get lower than 65 F. If it's not meant for mobile use, why include 12V capability and a carry handle? Very disappointing performance.  It's getting returned and we will be shopping for a different unit.

Just be aware when looking at the size that the compressor takes up a bit of space so the bottom inside is narrow due to this.

But it freezes good and cools good, just like your fridge at home but smaller.
Not noisy either.

129,"Galanz 3.1 Cu ft Two Door Mini Fridge, Black, New","I had to buy this fridge due to a kitchen remodel. I needed something to last for a few months while my kitchen was gutted. Was looking for something with a large freezer, and this freezer seemed large enough. It holds about 10 Stouffer's microwave meals, and a couple of ice cream pints with room for a regular size ice tray. Also there is some storage in the freezer door for smaller items. The settings have been tough to get right, and honestly I don't think I'll ever get them right. I wish more people would list the settings they use, but I know for a fact if you set it at 5, 6, or 7, it not only gets heavily frosted over in the freezer, but also in the fridge. I have mine set at 4 now, and ice cream stays solid, and fridge stays cold. But if you have drinks or anything really don't push it to the back of the fridge because drinks will freeze solid at 5 and above. This wasn't the freezer I wanted, I figured if I had to buy one I should get one I could use after the new kitchen was finished. But in the end I it has worked for what I needed it for and I just keep manually defrosting between restocking, The bin at the bottom is only half the depth of shelves, so not as useful as I believed. So I pulled it out, but I could see it as useful for fruits or veggies in small quantities. I can fit a half gallon of milk in the door, or a 2 liter. Cheese and butter in the fridge door, and some juice cans. I use the second shelf for a few drinks, bottom shelf for taller items like ketchup, salads, etc. The top shelf I only use for items that will not be damaged if they freeze a little. like leftover pizza.",4,10/17/2024,4.4

So so far I'm satisfied with how cold it's getting which is why I bought it because I had just bought a smaller “personal chiller” from a different brand that did not get cold enough so I had to take that one back. The only issue I'm having with it which was present before plugging in is that it is unbalanced so it tips over a little whenever I open it. It seems that one of the 4 feet/legs on the bottom 4 corners of the fridge must be slightly shorter than the others. It is annoying but so far not causing too much issue. It's also not too loud in my opinion. It does make noise but it is not constant. It gets a little louder after it's been open for a minute and probably the compressor/machine or something needs to work to keep it cool (idk how fridges work lol) so that is the loudest part but again, that specific noise is not constant.

With those things remaining, the best I could do was 10 cans. There was a bit of leftover space, but the fridge dimensions were wider than two cans, but narrower than three. Spacing the cans in a way that I could use a void to create room for two more cans, I was able to shoehorn in 10 total. That said, the directions show a ""plan"" for putting in 15 cans. And it works, though you have to keep your parts somewhere where you won't lose them.

So let's go through a few things:
- It's cheap. It's 100 percent plastic (only the door facing is ""stainless steel"" and it's not really ""stainless steel""). So cheap is good, but you get what you pay for.
- It comes with both a 120v plug and a car plug. That's cool.
- It has a handle to lift at the top. Also cool.
- It's light mostly because it's made of plastic, but it is good that it's light.
- There is no temperature variation. There is only one control: On/Off.
- It's not silent, but it is relatively quiet. It's not a distracting level of white noise (fan).

So all in all, it's a decent value for traveling with cool drinks on a road trip, or having a space in the office where you can keep your drinks out of the company fridge that co-worker Joe likes to pilfer.

All the electric appliances are unplugged there, and I needed a way to keep 2-3 bottles of water and some snacks for our 2 YO son cold. We have coolers, but large ones take up too much space in the SUV, and small ones compromise interior space with ice. I plugged the refrigerator into our house power (110V) the night before the road trip to pre-chill it. There are no temperature settings, just On/Off switch. I put in a wireless thermometer to monitor the fridge's temp. In the morning, it read 45 degrees F. We keep our home fridge at 34 F (for reference). I was disappointed with the mini fridge's performance but decided to take it anyway. I unplugged the fridge, moved it into our SUV, and plugged it into 12V DC. I added some COLD bottles of water and snacks, and we shortly departed. As we drove, I watched the fridge's interior temp climb from 50 F to 68 F.  The best it could do was chill to just below 70 F for the duration of the seven hour drive. The SUV's AC was kept between 70-73 F. When we arrived at our destination, I plugged the fridge in at the house to see if 110V AC would get the temp down. It took over 12 hours to get to 50 F.  For three days, we used the fridge to ""cool"" some bottles of water, but it couldn't get anything COLD! On the drive home, I plugged it into the SUV's 110V inverter. Again, the fridge could not get lower than 65 F. If it's not meant for mobile use, why include 12V capability and a carry handle? Very disappointing performance.

175,"Simzlife 126 Can Beverage Refrigerator and Cooler with Glass Door for Home, 17.5 in D, 31.5 in H, Silver","I waited a few months to ensure that I would get reliable, consistent service from this refrigerator before writing a review. First of all, it has freed up tons of space in the big refrigerator where we only keep milk and cream now. All other beverages go into this fridge and am happy to say that it keeps everything well chilled and right at hand. Being in Texas, we are always grabbing something cold to drink 10-11 months out of the year and this is a dream come true. I chilled the first beverages I put in the fridge before putting them in so I would not overwork the compressor. I started at 50 degrees and turned it 2-4 degrees colder every 12 hours until I got it set down to 32 degrees. It steadily holds between 33-36 all of the time which is perfect beverage temperature. I have a hanging thermometer on each shelf so I can see the difference in the zones, usually 1-2 degrees apart, with the bottom being the coldest, as expected. It does get a bit noisy when the compressor kicks on but I probably need to level it a bit better and most of the beverages are in glass bottles, so that adds to the noise. I notice it but it isn't annoying and it is about 5 feet away from my desk where I work all day. Personal note: I don't care for funky brand names all over everything and I found that a cottonball dipped in nail polish remover wiped the name off in about 3 seconds. No residue, just a nice, clean stainless steel frame! I am happy to buy this company's products, just not to advertise for them. Plus, Euhomy is a bit too close to Yomama to suit me.

One minor issue is the temperature display. It's green and emits enough light to bother him when he's trying to sleep.

It set to just one setting below the coldest.  I did not want to switch it to the coldest setting because honestly I don't know if the fridge can hold up or if it will make any difference.  I will try raising it to the highest setting (coldest temperature) but like I said, doesn't seem like it will make a difference if it can't freeze at second to highest setting.

The compact size is perfect for smaller spaces like dorm rooms, offices, or game rooms, fitting neatly without taking up too much room. Despite its size, it offers excellent storage capacity with thoughtful organizational features, including three adjustable glass shelves, three removable door bins, a transparent crisper drawer, and even a separate freezer compartment for frozen food, ice cream.

One of the standout features is the built-in 2.5-liter manual-fill water dispenser. I love that it doesn't require any water pipe connection, making it super convenient and easy to use. The exterior design is sleek and modern, with a flat door panel and stainless steel finish that adds a touch of elegance to any room.

Another big plus is its energy efficiency—it's EStar certified, meaning it consumes less power while keeping everything perfectly chilled. It's also impressively quiet, which makes it ideal for bedrooms or shared spaces where noise could be disruptive. The adjustable thermostat and legs make it easy to maintain the perfect temperature and ensure stability on uneven surfaces.

226,"Hisense 4.4 Cu ft Single Door Mini Refrigerator, 1 Year Warranty, Energy Star, WMS044M6XVE New","So I did read the reviews before I ordered this fridge, 
  I really did need a new one because my old one is dying , and I have lots of insulin that I need to keep cool. Perfect size , and my Hisense TV works great .. so ..  Fed Ex girl lugged it up 3 flights ( so sweet) the box was in perfect condition!! 
So I figured “ awesome” . 
 As I unboxed , I noticed the corner of the door looked like it was hit with a golf club .. huh .. Then I realized that the dents lined up perfectly with the staples in the box !! So it works , I’m not that upset .. but if you wanted a nice looking fridge, you WOULD be upset!!   I blame both Hisense for creating the problem, and Walmart.. should have been sold as “ scratch and dent” sale .   And it is a good sale ….  But tell people!!

233,"Hisense 4.4 Cu ft Single Door Mini Refrigerator, 1 Year Warranty, Energy Star, WMS044M6XVE New","Walmart offered a Hisense counter height refrigerator with a savings of $100, making the cost $100 plus tax.  We placed an order, and it was shipped to our home. The refrigerator was delivered as promised. The box showed no signs of damage or mishandling. When opened, there was a dent in the center of the refrigerator door. Walmart was contacted and a return was initiated. We placed another order for the same product.  The second refrigerator was delivered, and again the box showed no signs of damage.  The second refrigerator also has a dent. This is on the edge of the door.  The packaging had supports in all four corners to protect the edges from damage in shipping.  

It is very clear that both of the refrigerators were damaged before being boxed.  If Walmart was aware of these items being ""seconds"", or that there were potential flaws, they should have been marketed that way.  

The first refrigerator received is going back.  We have not made a decision on the second.  We are disappointed, and fairly disgusted with Walmart in that it appears they are offering goods known to have flaws.",1,4/18/2024,4.1

The door fits perfectly in my tight space kitchen, I say it saves a bit of energy from not opening a lot of space and just half door only. I like how it beeps when the door fridge is not completely closed.

The installation was easy except for I have to chop some cabinet part to fit the fridge into the old small short tight fridge space, had to make it work for this one. And no need to attach the water line, just plug to the outlet and it works.

This fridge is perfect for small single family, not a lot of space but just perfect for my preference. I like how it was easy to roll push around because if the wheel.

The hard part was bringing it inside the house, need  2 people to carry it in. Thought it was free installation and I can schedule a delivery but 2 things didnt happen, I have to wait and find some help for it.

264,Auseo 180 Can Beverage Refrigerator and Cooler with Stainless steel frame Glass Door for Home,"This was not the least expensive option overall, but it had the feature I wanted most at the best price: it gets the drinks cold.  We will seldom use it to chill wine as we drink mostly red, but juice, soda and adult beverages are best really cold, and it does that.  It was delivered upright so we waited 24hrs from delivery to plug in and we've had it going ever since.  It does hum, but not loud, temperature is adjustable to 31deg, I believe.  It will really look good in place in front of the old chimney and between the frig and freezer (as the remodel moves along).  
The shelves are coated and everything slides easily; they wipe clean easily and are adjustable to a point, so tall drinks could stand.  I prefer to lay them on their side; small clear bins keep cans corralled in the back with singles lined up in front.  I also use flat bins under opened juice bottles in case of leaks.

292,"Galanz 1.7 Cu ft Single Door Mini Fridge GL17BK, Black, New","It works. It's “cheap.” It's expensive not because of its price, but because of its value. What do I mean? Well let's start with the massive warning label on the back end of the refrigerator that says “don't poke holes in line, can explode…” yeah I'm paraphrasing , but I didn't sign up for a $40 explosive. Am I using it? Yes. But I don't foresee that lasting into the foreseeable future. I'm grateful for the products performance, for what it does provide in its small spaces. I'm only using it to store meals for the week. The side door is useless to me personally, but I'm sure if you're not storing food on the bottom shelf that can hold maybe 4 small containers. The top shelf will freeze your stuff, so I don't recommend it. All in all, I'm using the bottom shelf, not the side space or top space for the refrigerator and it's an explosive. I had to install it, it was easy. Finding the cord tucked and tapped all the way in the back? Yeah not so much or great, that was the longest delay of the entire process. 

I had to put the back of the refrigerator into a corner where it can't be turned around. I have a 10 month old Australian shepherd. So explosives because of a small hole is a high risk endeavor. 

If you have cats or dogs that are notorious for chewing or attacking objects, I strongly advise caution.

Outside that it does what it was advertised to do and does not bother me. The side door and top shelf not being used was a bit of a bummer but not the end of the world.",3,1/10/2025,4.4

The freezer is surprisingly roomy for a fridge of this size, easily accommodating all my frozen essentials. The overall build quality feels sturdy, and the features are thoughtfully designed for everyday use.

For the price, it offers incredible value—combining quality, functionality, and affordability. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a practical and efficient refrigerator!",5,12/7/2024,4.6

The movable shelves are a great idea to custimize the fridge for you. Though it's  a bit smaller than my old one, I find the freezer fits more items.

I do not like that I have to open both doors to access any of the drawers. The fridge is not high quality, and the black stainless scratches so easy. The one thing I really dislike is that the sides of the fridge are black, not stainless black, just black. The ice shoots out of the dispenser, making it hard to catch with a glass. The ice maker is quite small, and takes quite a while to make ice. So, if you use ice quite a bit I suggest having a bag of ice in the freezer as a backup.

Roomy, lots of space inside, the lighting is really good compared to our older fridge.  The interior finish is clean and minimalistic.  Interior parts feel quality compared to other brands.  The upper ice maker is what we prefer, and it is working well.  The space it takes from the fridge storage space is worth it.  The water and ice are a little noisy, but we expected it to be that way, and a satisfactory tradeoff for the functionality.  A few items to note, taking the plastic off when new was not fun.  Took patience and added effort.  Needed to use a sharp utility knife to get all of the plastic off.  The handle assembly was easy enough for most with minimal skills.  The freezer door gasket was not formed properly on top to make a good seal.  Ice was forming in the upper part of the freezer where air was getting in.  I had to apply some heat with a hair dryer, then used foam backing rod in the gasket to hold a tight seal against frame.  This took 2 days and I repeated 3 times to the gasket to seat properly.  All good now.  When installing the water for the dispenser, I had to adjust the water line fittings on the fridge as it started to leak.  The fridge side hose was not seated into the fittings correctly.  A less handy person may not have noticed or been able to fix on the spot.  This may have happened when it was delivered, but it was still a concern.  The exterior white finish is great, not the dimpled texture finish of the past.

The compact size is perfect for smaller spaces like dorm rooms, offices, or game rooms, fitting neatly without taking up too much room. Despite its size, it offers excellent storage capacity with thoughtful organizational features, including three adjustable glass shelves, three removable door bins, a transparent crisper drawer, and even a separate freezer compartment for frozen food, ice cream.

One of the standout features is the built-in 2.5-liter manual-fill water dispenser. I love that it doesn't require any water pipe connection, making it super convenient and easy to use. The exterior design is sleek and modern, with a flat door panel and stainless steel finish that adds a touch of elegance to any room.

Another big plus is its energy efficiency—it's EStar certified, meaning it consumes less power while keeping everything perfectly chilled. It's also impressively quiet, which makes it ideal for bedrooms or shared spaces where noise could be disruptive. The adjustable thermostat and legs make it easy to maintain the perfect temperature and ensure stability on uneven surfaces.

Overall, this refrigerator is the perfect blend of style, functionality, and convenience. If you're looking for a compact, energy-efficient fridge with a modern design and useful features like a water dispenser, this is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!",5,1/24/2025,4.777777777777778

The freezer fan was shorted out which disabled the power supply, So the fan was replaced under warranty and it's working again.
There are many useful features like craft ice and tap to turn on the light but I wonder just how many bells and whistles you really need.  The fact it is connected to our network is great for checking out the unit and testing to make sure it is working properly.  I really like it but I think the warranty should be reset if there is an issue until it can go a full year without any problems.

513,"Frigidaire, Retro 10L, 15-Can Mini Personal Fridge Cooler, EFMIS183, Stainless Steel","Bought the same model in stainless (gray) finish a year ago. Lasted less than a year. Bought the more recent black finish and it's much improved. The size and features are the same, but the electronics are a big improvement. The cooling plate was about 2.5 x 2.5 inches surrounded by plastic in the old version. Now the cooling area is spread over a metal interior covering the rear half inside. Result is more distributed cooling without freezing condensation from having a small metal plate and lots of water pooling inside. Now cooling is effective,  without condensation or pooling of water inside. Haven't had it long to comment on how long it may last, but I can testify electronics are a major improvement over the previous model, even though the model numbers are the same except for the color designator in the model number.",5,8/29/2024,4.0
514,"Frigidaire, Retro 10L, 15-Can Mini Personal Fridge Cooler, EFMIS183, Stainless Steel","While it says it holds 15 cans, there is a method required and all internal plastics (door and the shelf) have to be removed. With those things remaining, the best I could do was 10 cans. There was a bit of leftover space, but the fridge dimensions were wider than two cans, but narrower than three. Spacing the cans in a way that I could use a void to create room for two more cans, I was able to shoehorn in 10 total. That said, the directions show a ""plan"" for putting in 15 cans. And it works, though you have to keep your parts somewhere where you won't lose them.

So let's go through a few things:
- It's cheap. It's 100 percent plastic (only the door facing is ""stainless steel"" and it's not really ""stainless steel""). So cheap is good, but you get what you pay for.
- It comes with both a 120v plug and a car plug. That's cool.
- It has a handle to lift at the top. Also cool.
- It's light mostly because it's made of plastic, but it is good that it's light.
- There is no temperature variation. There is only one control: On/Off.
- It's not silent, but it is relatively quiet. It's not a distracting level of white noise (fan).

So all in all, it's a decent value for traveling with cool drinks on a road trip, or having a space in the office where you can keep your drinks out of the company fridge that co-worker Joe likes to pilfer.

But there is one flag here, from the Use %26 Care manual, and I quote:
""Do not store meats, poultry, fish, dairy products and other items that may spoil in unit for more than one hour.""

516,"Frigidaire, Retro 10L, 15-Can Mini Personal Fridge Cooler, EFMIS183, Stainless Steel","Bought this mini fridge for a short two day road trip to a home belonging to my in-laws that is up for sale. All the electric appliances are unplugged there, and I needed a way to keep 2-3 bottles of water and some snacks for our 2 YO son cold. We have coolers, but large ones take up too much space in the SUV, and small ones compromise interior space with ice. I plugged the refrigerator into our house power (110V) the night before the road trip to pre-chill it. There are no temperature settings, just On/Off switch. I put in a wireless thermometer to monitor the fridge's temp. In the morning, it read 45 degrees F. We keep our home fridge at 34 F (for reference). I was disappointed with the mini fridge's performance but decided to take it anyway. I unplugged the fridge, moved it into our SUV, and plugged it into 12V DC. I added some COLD bottles of water and snacks, and we shortly departed. As we drove, I watched the fridge's interior temp climb from 50 F to 68 F.  The best it could do was chill to just below 70 F for the duration of the seven hour drive. The SUV's AC was kept between 70-73 F. When we arrived at our destination, I plugged the fridge in at the house to see if 110V AC would get the temp down. It took over 12 hours to get to 50 F.  For three days, we used the fridge to ""cool"" some bottles of water, but it couldn't get anything COLD! On the drive home, I plugged it into the SUV's 110V inverter. Again, the fridge could not get lower than 65 F. If it's not meant for mobile use, why include 12V capability and a carry handle? Very disappointing performance.  It's getting returned and we will be shopping for a different unit.

The energy efficient features make this fridge inexpensive to run (the yellow card said about $50/year, we still have to see how that goes, but I noticed an immediate drop in my electrical bill when I replaced my older, half-broken, and inefficient refrigerator with this one). 
Overall, the fridge works very well; keeping the thermostat setting at the manufacturer's recommended point is advisable, trying to make the fridge a bit 'colder' resulted in frozen milk! Great product, that performs well and fits our budget.",5,11/11/2024,4.6

581,"Farberware Top Mount Double Door Refrigerator, Silver","This is more of a review of faberwares customer service than walmart.  Walmart shipped and product arrived very damaged.  Walmart passed me to Faberware.  I had to go back to Walmart to get any type of compensation without loosing most of my money.

Firdge works great.  

I had to travel with mine so once installed removal would be tough and required paid help.  Door was damanged a lot.  Even crushed in some areas.  I had been out of refridgeration for a while so I had to let them complete installation even after noticing issue.  Install and myself figured we could just get them to send a door which would be much cheaper for them and me.

I asked for a replacement door since I paid to have it installed and have no help.  Faberware did not try to solve problem and would only offer full refund after receiving a return. Walmart only offered $100 refund or I could pay to have it loaded up and return it.

I know they could send a replacement door. I cannot find one to purchase.  I will probably end up giving it away and buying a new one if i get tired of looking at a crushed door.  I paid for a new fridge.  They should cover that or my removal.  I could end up paying more than fridge is woth to send back.  I know they could send us replacement parts.  I would be chaper for them as well.

This was a mistake by the packaging or shipping.  Product itself is great.  I felt like they handled that wrong and made no attempts to work with me.  I am will to do labor or swapping doors.  They have them because they are still making recridgerators.",1,11/12/2024,4.636363636363637

I called prior, spoke to customer service to please make note of how fragile these are, that its a gift, and to please be careful. I even wrote an additional request in the delivery instructions for my order pleading the same thing. I ALSO asked to please call me prior to arriving so I could open the front door and inspect it before they drove off, to ensure the fridge wasn't damaged. I never received a call, the driver drove off as I tried to flag him down, I could immediately tell even still in the box, that it was damaged. And after spending nearly 45 minutes unboxing it, taking off all the shrink wrap, cardboard, foam, tape, plastic, etc. and throwing it all away, I was left with my long-awaited gift dented in 4 separate areas on the front door, 2 additional corners dented in, and a large scuff mark, also on the front door, thru the black paint. And now I'm sitting here, wondering what on earth am I going to do. It was obvious the driver took off because he saw my instructions, saw that it was damaged, and didnt want to stick around to deal with it. I even had an amazing deal on a different retro style fridge at another store I could've seen in person and picked up myself, but I still went with this one bc it was the one he wanted for so long, and I thought maybe, just maybe, I could one if those very few that received it undamaged.  And whats incredible,  is that you'd think for all the damage it was shipped across the country.

First of all, it has freed up tons of space in the big refrigerator where we only keep milk and cream now. All other beverages go into this fridge and am happy to say that it keeps everything well chilled and right at hand. Being in Texas, we are always grabbing something cold to drink 10-11 months out of the year and this is a dream come true. I chilled the first beverages I put in the fridge before putting them in so I would not overwork the compressor. I started at 50 degrees and turned it 2-4 degrees colder every 12 hours until I got it set down to 32 degrees. It steadily holds between 33-36 all of the time which is perfect beverage temperature. I have a hanging thermometer on each shelf so I can see the difference in the zones, usually 1-2 degrees apart, with the bottom being the coldest, as expected. It does get a bit noisy when the compressor kicks on but I probably need to level it a bit better and most of the beverages are in glass bottles, so that adds to the noise. I notice it but it isn't annoying and it is about 5 feet away from my desk where I work all day. Personal note: I don't care for funky brand names all over everything and I found that a cottonball dipped in nail polish remover wiped the name off in about 3 seconds. No residue, just a nice, clean stainless steel frame! I am happy to buy this company's products, just not to advertise for them. Plus, Euhomy is a bit too close to Yomama to suit me.

701,"Frigidaire 14 Cu. Ft. Top Freezer Refrigerator, White","We had to replace our refrigerator and selected this one because of its smaller size. It's fine for just the two of us. In order to keep freezer and fridge cold, you must be sure not to block the vents in back of freezer or refrigerator with anything, from ice cube trays to a bag of coffee. Also it's only been about a month and doors do not close automatically - you need to GENTLY “help” them to close and seal all the way. Easy to clean, spacious vegetable crisper. It's supposed to also be used for fruit but how can you set control (only one) for two different temp/humidity needs when there's only one drawer? We use a 2nd fridge in our garage for the fruit. And anything that might not fit in main (Frigidaire) refrigerator (large pots of soup, watermelon, extra produce). I like the fridge, I'm a little concerned about the doors already.

735,"Galanz 4.3 Cu ft Single Door Mini Fridge, Black Estar, New, Width 19.92""","I bought this refrigerator for my sister Carlene who lives in Duluth, MN.  It was delivered to Bay Shore Rehabilitation where she is living at for the time being due to being handicapped and needing her 4th major back surgery.  
 Fridge was delivered to Bay Shore and had visual damage to the outside of the box and when opened there is damage to the front door of the fridge.  A 1” hole is punched into the door.  
I called WM to see if Carlene (my sister) would be able to get a refund on the fridge.  Carlene does not own a vehicle, she has no way to return it to a Duluth or Superior Walmart Store. 
Customer Service told me it could not be returned if it weighed 70 lbs.  This statement was false I got told by a Supervisor from Headquarters.  I asked if Walmart could come pick up the fridge due to the fact that Carlene is handicapped, needs 4th major back surgery, does not own a car and has no way to get the fridge to the local Walmart.  
I got told that pickup of a damaged electrical product was not in their (WM) policy.  I asked if they would give a full / partial refund for the damaged fridge  and we would use it the way it is.  No that can't be done, not the WM policy.
Then I got told they could give me a Promo Code.  I asked how much?  $15.00 I got told. 
I then asked to speak to a Supervisor to find out if they could override that $15.00 amount.
I waited on hold for 60 minutes before it was my turn.  There were 5 people ahead of me.  
Explained the situation to supervisor and I got told it was not in the WM policy to do a pickup.  Even if you are handicapped, have no car or any way to return fridge to a WM store.  No refund and keep damaged item.  Not in the WM store policy.  
No caring or compassion to try and help me out.  We can give you a $15.00 Promo Code.  I said No I won't accept that.  I am not a happy customer and I won't shop at WM anymore!

I ordered the fridge online due to the fact my sister is handicapped and doesn't own a car %26, I live 200 miles away from her, and she doesn't have a way to go shopping.  
Sadly if there is a problem, WM didn't try to hard to help out a handicapped senior citizen resolve the damaged fridge issue.",1,12/15/2024,4.2
