10,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","My son's favorite Christmas gift. He was so entertained by every aspect of the piano. From the eyes being able to be spun, to the characters moving when you play the piano, and the silly noise settings. He has been non stop with it since he opened it. I also like the bare minimum packaging it comes with!!",5,12/30/2024,4.8

13,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys",My now 5 year old kept eyeballing this toy and playing with it in the store. I ended up buying it as a surprise for one of his birthday presents. He has two younger siblings. This toy was a hit with all 3 of them :),5,11/26/2024,4.8

15,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","I love the creativity they designed this with. 
Kids can play a variety of sounds - make fun sounds - watch the balls light up and move up and down - and play their own songs. My grandkids love it!",5,12/3/2024,4.8
16,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys",My 20 month old loves  it. He is a wild child that likes to throw things. This piano has survived his throws and being used as a step stool. He has not lost interest and comes back to use it regularly.,5,10/29/2024,4.8
17,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","I bought this for my 18 month old son, who enjoys toys that play music and light up, who didn't care much for a more basic toy piano I bought him prior to this one. 

I thought the responses to pressing the keys would interest my son more, and they did for a short while, but he quickly lost interest in playing it and would become frustrated at the many buttons available to press above the keys themselves. I think it's really neat how the little, colorful figures inside the tubes go up and down and light up when you press the keys… I also like how there's an actual STOP button you can hit to make the music immediately quit playing (most toy pianos make you cycle through songs by pressing a button, eventually cycling through enough and    hitting the no song option). The motor that blows the air inside the tubes turns itself off after a short while, and remains off until keys are pressed again.. so, this toy you can actually leave ON and have it only function whenever your kid is actually playing with it, no need to keep turning it off and on and having a frustrated kid who always needs you to turn a toy on for them. 

I did end up returning the toy, but only because it wasn't for my son, at this time. He may be a little too young to really enjoy such a toy, or it might just not be his thing at the moment. 

However, that's the only reason and has nothing to do with the toy in any other way. I think it's very well made, very cute and love how the eyes on it can roll, the settings and features are great and the choices of sounds on key press are also fantastic. 

It would make a great toy for a kid maybe 2-3 years old or more. Especially those who are interested in music and love animals. My favorite feature is when you press the keys and it plays the next note of a popular song, like Twinkle twinkle little star (you may press any key and it plays the proper note in the song, and keeps playing the proper consecutive notes upon more key presses). 

It's unique, that's for sure!",4,12/16/2024,4.8
18,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","My daughter who is about to turn two found this toy at walmart and absolutely loved it. Therefore a couple weeks later i decided to order it through walmart plus as a birthday gift. Luckily i tried to test it before wrapping it because the toy i recieved wouldn't turn on/play due to dead batteries. Needless to say, I thought 30 dollars was a little high for this toy but then having to pay another $10 for batteries, in my opinion, makes it not worth the cost . If you're considering buying this product, your better off buying it in store.",1,1/23/2025,4.8

20,"INTMEDIC Pop Up Animal Toys with Light and Music, Cause and Effect Toys for Baby 6 to 12 Months Boys and Girls Gift for Infant","While this is different than what I was originally looking for (all smash buttons to pop open), I actually love that they have to do different things to pop each animal! 

My little one loves to close them while my toddler loves to open them for him! We haven't put batteries in it, so I can't say anything about the sound part, but the buttons and animals are great!",5,1/17/2025,4.6923076923076925

50,LeapFrog Let’s Record! Music Player Baby and Toddler Toys,We had previously bought this product %26 were ****% satisfied with it. Unfortunately it was accidently broken by a 3 year old child. The product was well constructed but was not designed to withstand the abuse it received. As such we decided to buy another as the child  really enjoys playing with it while traveling.,5,10/24/2024,4.7
51,LeapFrog Let’s Record! Music Player Baby and Toddler Toys,"Bought this for my Grandsons. Great value. Was even more impressed when I played with it in person. Small for little hands, has preprogrammed songs, does have bluetooth so I can play Barney or sesame street songs right from my phone, and the speaker sounds GOOD to be a kids toy. I dont know if it has a volume on the side bc it was still in the box when I played with it. This is, BY FAR... my favorite gift this season. Got it on sale for 20$ but this would be a good toy even at 30$.",5,11/14/2024,4.7
52,LeapFrog Let’s Record! Music Player Baby and Toddler Toys,"my daughter loves her ""radio""!
I wish it came with instructions but it's not hard to figure out how to record. Until you fill all 10 recording slots, it just puts the recordings in the next spot from 1 to 10. once all spots are full, you can chose which number to record over if you make more recordings",5,12/16/2023,4.7
53,LeapFrog Let’s Record! Music Player Baby and Toddler Toys,"What it is: a small baby-friendly bluetooth speaker with 40 built in songs and a record feature. it performs the speaker role well, but really shines in the volume and quality of baby music available. My 14 month old son loves turning it on and just listening to the built in music, and being able to pipe in other music for him via the Bluetooth feature is very fun. It's definitely one of the better purchases we have made for him.",5,2/25/2024,4.7
54,LeapFrog Let’s Record! Music Player Baby and Toddler Toys,"Gift for my 4 1/2 year old grandson.  At 1st glance looks like a baby toy, but once he sat down and was shown all the functions he was thrilled.

60,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys",My Precious Princess Loved her keyboard. I believe she's going to be a pianist the way she Instantly placed her hands on the keys and began making Sweet Tiny Tot Tunes! Definitely would recommend for those that loves musical toys. Looks Just as shown in the picture possibly a tad bigger in person.,5,10/1/2024,4.1
61,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","Surprised at all one can do with this toy piano.  I had fun trying out most of them.  We'll see how the ""little 2 year old reciever"" does with it.  It appears very well made, more sturdy than most toys for sure.   Great opportunuity for one to get their creative juices flowing.   Thanks, I will be looking for more products from this company.",5,12/17/2024,4.1
62,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","This toy is awesome! All the features work as advertised. The microphone is the best part. This toy was meant for my 12 month old, but my four year old and 11 year old also play with it. My 11 year old likes re creating the tunes. It comes with batteries. We've had it for 3 months and the batteries are still going strong.",5,12/3/2023,4.1
63,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","This is the PERFECT keyboard for any child who tends to be rougher with their toys. It has the coolest options, including volume control. I highly recommend it.",5,1/21/2025,4.1
64,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","This is such a cute toy and has many options for kids to stay interested.  The sound is reasonably good for a toy, it's colorful and fun.  My grandkids love it.",5,1/1/2025,4.1
65,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","This is such a cool kid piano. It plays several children songs and even comes with a lyric booklet. There's an option to record a piano tune but it does not have the option to record your voice when singing into the microphone, which would be nice. It has several sound options other than a piano sound, like organ, violin and trumpet.... and a dog bark. It plays a tempo?? (forgive my lack of musical knowledge), which can be sped up or slowed down. My 3 year old loves it and slept with it the first night he got it. He likes to hold it by the microphone, which causes the whole thing to dangle, so I hope it doesn't break. Definitely recommend this puppy piano. Definitely kid and parent friendly!",5,7/10/2020,4.1
66,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","It's cute the kids love it!
This is easy to use and easy to figure out . It has a carry handle at the back so kids can easily transport it around. It also has rubber stoppers on the bottom so it won't slide around a table.
The keyboard has five different sound modes piano, music box, trumpet, violin, organ. There is also a mode you could play as a dog barking.

The volume can be turned up and down and max volume isn't annoyingly loud! 
It has 22 kids songs and melodies, there are also buttons to speed the tempo or those up and down.
There are five beats you can play along with ! 
The kids favorite thing is probably the microphone. There is a microphone on the corner with a short, retractable string, echoes, your voice, and makes it a bit louder.
There is an also a record and playback function, so Children can record the music on here!",5,11/10/2023,4.1
67,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys","This is a really cute piano and my daughter loves it. I like that you can change the sound of the keys (like trumpet, strings and it even “woofs”), and the option to record your own songs is also fun. I'm annoyed that the off position is in the middle of the slide instead of all the way to the right or left, which makes it harder for younger kids to turn it off on their own. The biggest complaint though, is that it breaks after just a few months. I'm on my third or fourth piano and all of the previous ones have done the same thing. They eventually start making a very faint clicking/feedback type of noise and then they die, and replacing the batteries does nothing. I could be wrong, but I think it has to do with the fact that the microphone never turns off. I wonder if the microphone is supposed to turn off when you slide the power button to one side or the other, but it is technically always on and I think this causes problems in the long run. So, I love the idea of the piano and it's very cute, but it does not last and it appears to be a design failure.",2,10/1/2024,4.1
68,"Spark Create Imagine Rolo's Keyboard Musical Instrument Toy, Baby and Toddler Toys",I was very disappointed.  Got it home and it didn't work. Was supposed to come with batteries but there was none. I gather that someone else bought the keyboard. It didn't work and they kept the batteries. What is very upsetting is that it was put back on the shelf broken to be sold to someone else. More trouble for you and me.,1,5/30/2024,4.1

I decided to purchase anyway due to lack of a better option that I could get in time and an adult reviewer saying they felt it was so enjoyable to use it was nearly addictive. Once it arrived, my 10 yr old tried the demo features and agreed it was surprisingly good. Her friend also liked it.

185,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys",My 20 month old loves  it. He is a wild child that likes to throw things. This piano has survived his throws and being used as a step stool. He has not lost interest and comes back to use it regularly.,5,10/29/2024,4.8
186,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","I bought this for my 18 month old son, who enjoys toys that play music and light up, who didn't care much for a more basic toy piano I bought him prior to this one. 

I thought the responses to pressing the keys would interest my son more, and they did for a short while, but he quickly lost interest in playing it and would become frustrated at the many buttons available to press above the keys themselves. I think it's really neat how the little, colorful figures inside the tubes go up and down and light up when you press the keys… I also like how there's an actual STOP button you can hit to make the music immediately quit playing (most toy pianos make you cycle through songs by pressing a button, eventually cycling through enough and    hitting the no song option). The motor that blows the air inside the tubes turns itself off after a short while, and remains off until keys are pressed again.. so, this toy you can actually leave ON and have it only function whenever your kid is actually playing with it, no need to keep turning it off and on and having a frustrated kid who always needs you to turn a toy on for them. 

I did end up returning the toy, but only because it wasn't for my son, at this time. He may be a little too young to really enjoy such a toy, or it might just not be his thing at the moment. 

However, that's the only reason and has nothing to do with the toy in any other way. I think it's very well made, very cute and love how the eyes on it can roll, the settings and features are great and the choices of sounds on key press are also fantastic. 

It would make a great toy for a kid maybe 2-3 years old or more. Especially those who are interested in music and love animals. My favorite feature is when you press the keys and it plays the next note of a popular song, like Twinkle twinkle little star (you may press any key and it plays the proper note in the song, and keeps playing the proper consecutive notes upon more key presses). 

It's unique, that's for sure!",4,12/16/2024,4.8

It features big, smooth buttons that are easy for tiny hands to manipulate and 'choose' the music they wish to hear. The rounded edges ensure it's safe and the fact there are two volume settings mean it's not obnoxiously loud but is loud enough to keep my baby engaged. There are several different tunes included, which offers a nice nice variety. This is key because my son has this thing going ALL the time!! The lights are fun and engaging and he loves isolating instruments and adding sounds in to the tunes. It's easy to roll and light enough for him to pick up without feeling cheap. It's also really easy to clean. I have the Baby Einstein turtle toy with a similiar 'make-your-own-orchestra' design and it's not anywhere near as engaging or well made as this toy.

The music this plays is nice and soothing on both baby and parents. LOVE IT! I also love the design of this cube. It doesn't have sharp edges, and yet it is round enough that it doesn't roll away when baby goes to grab it.

The music is at the perfect sound level, and the song is very pleasant, even after hearing it 50 times in a row. The only suggestion I have, is if it was able to play more than one song. But each instrument has it's part of the song, and then the orchestra button plays all of the instruments together, so I think the technology would be challenging to get more than one song on the toy.",5,7/2/2019,4.4

She and I use it to pretend we are a band and bang on pots and pans or make up songs to go with the music. We really capture his attention with it. He hasn't shown much interest in playing with it by himself, but that's okay. It seems to be a toy that will grow with our family, and I think it will hold up for quite some time.",4,10/14/2015,4.4

It shouldn't be surprising but maybe still worth stating, none of the sounds are very true to their representative instrument. It is a fun toy but not durable enough for the price.",2,2/7/2024,4.4

I was a little disappointed that I didn't receive the stacking towers but I realized later that it is randomized. Almost everything is made of wood and not all of it is sanded or sealed properly.

I also like the bare minimum packaging it comes with!!",5,12/30/2024,4.8

Kids can play a variety of sounds - make fun sounds - watch the balls light up and move up and down - and play their own songs. My grandkids love it!",5,12/3/2024,4.8
435,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys",My 20 month old loves  it. He is a wild child that likes to throw things. This piano has survived his throws and being used as a step stool. He has not lost interest and comes back to use it regularly.,5,10/29/2024,4.8
436,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","I bought this for my 18 month old son, who enjoys toys that play music and light up, who didn't care much for a more basic toy piano I bought him prior to this one. 

I thought the responses to pressing the keys would interest my son more, and they did for a short while, but he quickly lost interest in playing it and would become frustrated at the many buttons available to press above the keys themselves. I think it's really neat how the little, colorful figures inside the tubes go up and down and light up when you press the keys… I also like how there's an actual STOP button you can hit to make the music immediately quit playing (most toy pianos make you cycle through songs by pressing a button, eventually cycling through enough and    hitting the no song option). The motor that blows the air inside the tubes turns itself off after a short while, and remains off until keys are pressed again.. so, this toy you can actually leave ON and have it only function whenever your kid is actually playing with it, no need to keep turning it off and on and having a frustrated kid who always needs you to turn a toy on for them. 

I did end up returning the toy, but only because it wasn't for my son, at this time. He may be a little too young to really enjoy such a toy, or it might just not be his thing at the moment. 

However, that's the only reason and has nothing to do with the toy in any other way. I think it's very well made, very cute and love how the eyes on it can roll, the settings and features are great and the choices of sounds on key press are also fantastic. 

It would make a great toy for a kid maybe 2-3 years old or more. Especially those who are interested in music and love animals. My favorite feature is when you press the keys and it plays the next note of a popular song, like Twinkle twinkle little star (you may press any key and it plays the proper note in the song, and keeps playing the proper consecutive notes upon more key presses). 

It's unique, that's for sure!",4,12/16/2024,4.8
437,"Battat Croco Pop Piano Toy Keyboard with Songs Sounds Lights, Baby and Toddler Toys","My daughter who is about to turn two found this toy at walmart and absolutely loved it. Therefore a couple weeks later i decided to order it through walmart plus as a birthday gift. Luckily i tried to test it before wrapping it because the toy i recieved wouldn't turn on/play due to dead batteries. Needless to say, I thought 30 dollars was a little high for this toy but then having to pay another $10 for batteries, in my opinion, makes it not worth the cost . If you're considering buying this product, your better off buying it in store.",1,1/23/2025,4.8
