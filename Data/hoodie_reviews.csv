0,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,This Snoop Dogg blanket hoodie is a family favorite for our kids as we travel or just lounging on the couch at home. This is a large or extra large and meant to be oversized. The fabric is super soft and quite warm. I don't you can go wrong with this for a gift. The price point is very affordable which is an added bonus. We are excited to use this when winter is upon us!!!,5,11/4/2024,4.8
1,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"My teen tried this on in a small- medium and the fit was great. The material is ridiculously soft and fuzzy! Softer than most blankets, so this would be perfect to snuggle up in to relax or sleep. The material, while super soft, was a bit heavy for his taste, so it's probably only something he would use when it's super cold outside. This would be great for wearing around the house, or even outside on super cold days.",5,11/11/2024,4.8
2,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"I am 5-7 and wear L TO XL. This is a L-XL jacket. What a cool product. Long, warm but not too heavy. No messy zippers just pull it over like a hoody and sit by the fire. Has large pockets that could carry the kitchen in them.

With a variety of designs this is truly a fun item that could be worn out everyday or for camping type events or at home",5,11/14/2024,4.8

This sweatshirt is super long and its length hits about the knees. This also has a hood which is a bonus. Material is black with a white design print throughout. My grandpa is six foot six inches tall and 250lbs. He has this in a size large extra-large. This and he loves wearing it on the couch when it's cold outside.,5,11/14/2024,4.8
4,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"I love my Snoop Dogg Oversized Blanket Hoodie! This hoodie is the truth. It's very comfortable, soft and the oversized hoodie completely covers my face and put me in do no disturb mode. I'm 5'11 235lbs, and bought an XL, but an L would have worked just fine. I plan to purchase another one and I highly recommend to purchase. Great price!",5,1/12/2025,4.8
5,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"Love this fleece-like thing. I live in a state that is not ultra cold in the winter, but cold enough. I've fallen asleep with it on a couple of times. I have two of these as gifts for Christmas, and they said it was a great, thoughtful gift, too. I highly recommend these.",5,1/10/2025,4.8
6,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"I got a size S/M for my 13yr old son. He's tall and thin. About 115lbs and 5'6"". This is pretty big on him, but it's supposed to be big. Like a blanket. He loves it!! He put it on as soon as he opened it on Christmas day and wears it all the time! It's VERY thick, puffy, and soft! It has a hood too. It seems very well made and washed well. Great item for a great price!",5,1/6/2025,4.8
7,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"So exciting that Snoop Dogg has his own line of clothing now. This oversize blanket hoodie with pouch was so soft and comfortable. My husband said he didn't want to take it off as it felt like he was wearing a blanket. He normally wears an adult medium, and this size fit him well with plenty of room to have clothing on underneath. He said he was looking forward to wearing this on the couch and relaxing in it.",4,11/14/2024,4.8
8,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"This item is honestly like wearing a full fleece blanket. My husband is wearing a large and it looks like a triple X. It is incredibly warm and would be perfect for sitting on the couch and watching a movie, I doubt he would ever wear this out of the house because it looks pretty ridiculous on him.  so my recommendation would be if you want a wearable blanket by this, but if you wanna be in public definitely don't",4,11/10/2024,4.8
9,Dogg Supply by Snoop Dogg Men's Original Oversized Wearable Blanket with Kangaroo Pocket,"great gift. but recommend checking before gifting, mine that i gifted had stains on the item. i never took it out the plastic that it came in, and came with the stain..with the material and color of stain might not be able to get out, without ruining the item",4,12/25/2024,4.8
10,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL","this particular seller's hoodie is a tiny bit better quality  than if you buy it from another place   the one I got was a slight bit better than qualities elsewhere  of same product was it worth the extra money for the slight bit of quality ,  the extra quality I don't think is worth the extra money ,  but it's subjective  if you want a tiny bit better quality  Nobody makes anything like they used to  Heaviness and quality",5,12/11/2024,4.6
11,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL","This is a great little hoodie. I buy men's because they just seem to fit me so much better and they're so much more comfortable than women. When you get bigger and older, you look for things that are comfortable and fit you kind of loose. I just love how this one feels. It's not exactly for winter, but it's a great hoodie to wear like under a jacket to work I know for sure I will be wearing this before spring breaks.",5,12/18/2024,4.6
12,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL",Arrived fast very bright and thicker then most hoodies. Did ok being washed and dried didn't seem to shrink or loose color. Happy with my purchase. Would recommend it to others.,5,1/7/2025,4.6

16,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL",I purchased this sweatshirt to make a custom sweatshirt for my nephew's birthday. The quality was great for the price that I paid and the heat press vinyl stuck to it with no issues. I would definitely purchase again.,5,11/12/2023,4.6
17,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL","Description is misleading, in no way is this heavy weight. However, my expectations were low before I ordered, and having said that, it's alright for a thin, zip-up hoodie and approximately what I was expecting when I placed my order. Definitely not the old-school Gildan quality, but works for what I wanted, something lightweight to wear around the house and out and about for errands.",4,1/5/2025,4.6
18,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL","You must have changed your product line.   The zipper is inferior to the previously used zipper.  I've been buying Gilden hoodies for years- this one imo is comparable to Kmart quality, less than good.  

Also, please go back to all cotton, the synthetic crap sux",4,1/7/2025,4.6
19,"Gildan Unisex Heavy Blend Fleece Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt, Size Small to 3XL","it is advertised as heavy and fleece lined. In reality, it is a light jacket, with a little fuzz in the inside of the material.

23,"Wrangler® Men's Hooded Pullover, Sizes S-3XL","I'd never worn any Wrangler clothes besides their OG jeans so I was happy to try these lightweight hoodies, and I was a little surprised at how perfect they are.

I liked it so much that I came back & got another one.",5,10/26/2024,4.7

30,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"These are honestly the nest hooded sweatshirts I've ever owned.  Not only are they made well, they can be dressed up for work, and can be dressed down leggings.  I adored the first one I purchased so I bought two more.  They are nicer in person when you're able to see and feel the quality.  I don't ever leave reviews but I felt compelled to because of the number of compliments I receive each time I wear one.",5,1/28/2025,4.6
31,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"I was shopping for an inexpensive hoodie and found this at 24$. I also wanted a really large hoodie so I went with an xl, I normally wear a medium. I love it sooo much I bought one for my daughter in law for Christmas. And then I bought a 3rd one in my normal size, medium. As a medium, it is roomy but fits well, it is oversized so it is longer and a touch wider. Perfect fit so I can say it is true to size and you don't need to go 2 sizes bigger for a roomier feel. Excellent purchase!",5,12/25/2024,4.6
32,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"My hoodie arrived in a shrink wrap and was wrinkled when I opened it. It looked fine though, but I didn't want to wear it until I washed it because I wanted to see how it would hold up. It did not shrink at all and fit just the way I wanted it too. I think the value is very very good. I'm going to buy more in different colors. My hoodie arrived in a shrink wrap and was wrinkled when I opened it.

33,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"I ordered the pink one and fell in love.  I then ordered all the colors.  The pink and the blue are so soft inside and out, they feel like a big hug on a cold day.  The brown and black, on the other hand are the cold step sisters.  The material of the brown  and black are definitely not the same, they are not bad, but no hug from them!  The pink and blue are a five star.",5,12/31/2024,4.6
34,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"These hoodies are ""the best"". Great fit, comfortable, warm, and they look nice too.

37,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"This hoodie is a nice colour and is warm and soft. However, it has pfd proportions....it is a bit long for a size large, but has short arms, and has a tendency for the entire hoodie to raise up when i lift my arms at all. 
It also shows any marks very easily and is easily stained. It pills up horribly after washing and any shirt underneath gets covered in lint. 
I'm very disappointed.",2,1/20/2025,4.6
38,UVN Hoodies for Women Fleece Hooded Sweatshirts Oversized Pullover Long Sleeve Ladies Tops with Pocket,"This is NOT an oversized hoodie and I was not allowed to return it even though it said return eligible until January 31, 2025.

42,SUNBS Oversized Hoodies for Women Fall Fashion Sweatshirts Pullover Womens Clothes with Pocket,"Soft, thick fabric, easy on the skin when waaring. Nice that it is oveesized. Warm as well.  I ordered an XL but actually the large fits best.  My hubby stole the two XL from me and I ordered a size smaller  in the large and they are perfect for my frame. I am wide thru the midsection 180 lbs, 5'5"" and wear a size 14 pants, in case this helps.",5,12/31/2024,4.7
43,SUNBS Oversized Hoodies for Women Fall Fashion Sweatshirts Pullover Womens Clothes with Pocket,This is the absolute best sweatshirt I have ever worn!! It is much thicker and warmer than I expected. It washed up nicely. The fit is true to size and so comfortable. Keep in mind that it is supposed to be Oversized so if you want a sweatshirt that is not roomy then you will want to size down.

49,SUNBS Oversized Hoodies for Women Fall Fashion Sweatshirts Pullover Womens Clothes with Pocket,not really oversized. shorter than I'd have expected for an oversized hoodie. it was just pretty normal sized in a 2x. good weight. not too heavy for the desert Southwest warmer winters (just around freezing nearly at the lowest all winter. this winter it's been 73° since October. this week turned cold for us (37 low) and it was comfy indoors in 66°. it's really comfy. you might want layers before freezing,4,1/10/2025,4.7
50,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL",It is very comfortable. It is lighter in weight than most hoodies.

51,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL","Purchased these hoodies for my husband. He loves them. What he really loves about them is the hoodie.

53,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL","I honestly can't believe how incredible this hoodie is! I've been wanting the camo one from Abercrombie but couldn't justify the price. For being an all over print, I assume it's screen printed but it's not a hard or rough fabric, it's so soft. The inside feels like a comfortable fleece and I'm always hot and this material doesn't make me sweaty.",5,11/10/2024,4.7

57,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL","Comfy and cute. I am usually a women's S but wanted an oversized sweatshirt to wear with leggings so I bought an M. Fits the way I wanted! The only thing I'd warn about is it had that store smell when I got it, and it took multiple washes to get rid of it.",4,1/4/2025,4.7
58,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL","So if you wanna wear this as a cute set like it is in the picture, the matching sweatpants bottoms are very warm, toned and the sleeves of the brown multicolored hoodie top are very cool town so somehow they match in the picture however they are very very different colors in real life. If you want pants that match the multicolor brown hoodie, you have to pick the clay pants which will match the main tan part of the hoodie.  Figured I would try and save someone else the hassle.",3,12/30/2024,4.7
59,"No Boundaries All Gender Oversized Soft Fleece Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Men's Sizes XS-5XL",This is no better quality wise as the 5.98 ones they sell at the store. I wished I had brought the less expensive ones cause to my they are made better material. These ones seem really thin and arm are. Not snugged around the wrist.,3,12/28/2024,4.7
60,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL",Very comfortable. For the price it can't be beat. I ended up buying 2 more just lounge around in. I've been wearing them almost daily. Definitely would recommend. For reference I'm 6'0 and bought a size medium and it fits great. Not too loose and falls just below my waist,5,9/28/2024,4.7

62,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL","Nice hoodie for the price.  I haven't washed it yet to see if it will result in pilling. Usually sweatshirts this cheap do that.  You can also get a fabric shaver to keep your clothes looking newer.  
Btw I'm a size 2 and a mens medium is oversized just enough to make it comfortable.   Nice thick sweatshirt with fleece inside.  Came same day too!!!",5,1/26/2025,4.7
63,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL","I am a female but like the fit of the men's hoodie. I am 5'9 and usually wear a 18/20 and this hoodie was a bit oversized but that's how I like to wear my hoodies. The material isn't too thick but just right to keep me warm in these cooler months. 

The arms are a bit long, but again, that's what I like, cause I usually wear hoodies when it's cold and so it helps to keep my hands warm. And I like that it is long enough to hide my belly and bottom.

 I am not a name brand kind of person for getting this hoodie for less then $20 was just want I needed. I plan to buy other colors as well.",5,1/22/2025,4.7

65,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL","This hoodie that I ordered, which was one of six that I bought, was true to size and is good in quality. However the shipping experience was a nightmare.  I ordered 3 large hoodies, they were delivered on different times. The black large I ordered was huge, much larger that than the navy blue one.  It should've been labeled as an xxl.   The gray one I ordered still hasn't arrived.   The three mediums I ordered two are true to size the black one is a little smaller.  They were also delivered at different times, even though his I ordered them was on one ticket.  The quality is good but the sizes are all over the place.  It appears there is no quality control on how the hoodies are made and labeled for sizes.",5,12/15/2024,4.7

I ordered 3 of these, all in XX sizes, because they're all for 3  heavy men. I only received 2 and need for tomorrow get together.  If you didn't have the correct size why not just let me know instead of sending what you have in stock. Angry,  and a long time great customer.

68,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL",I don't understand how order changed to all black when I didn't order any black and why the order continually goes to Bandera Rd. Store when I don't shop at that store. I picked the one on Vance Jackson as my favorite store and it is equal distance just with a different zip code.,1,12/19/2024,4.7
69,"Athletic Works Men's Fleece Pullover Hoodie with Long Sleeves, Sizes S-5XL",The material this sweatshirt is made of is nothing but garbage. All the white inside comes off. I washed the two new sweatshirts that I got both the same colors same company together. when I took him out of the washer it looked like they had white polka dots all over and that's how much was on it. I took him and I put them in a dryer at the laundromat so I didn't ruin mine. when I pulled them out of the dryer I stood there and shook them on the floor and it looked like a snowstorm plus the wind trap was full. I noticed on the zip up one there was gray spots where all the white stuff come off the pullover it was mostly the hood that was bare. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst nightmare. or enemy.,1,12/10/2024,4.7
70,"Fruit of the Loom Men's Crafted Comfort Super Soft Cotton Blend Fleece Hoodie Sweatshirt, Sizes S - 2XL","I bought this sweatshirt for my spouse, and he loves it. We're both picky about hoodies, and this one is definitely a keeper—very soft, medium-heavy weight. Appears to be a decently dense weave that should last a long time and get better with washing.

83,"Athletic Works Men's and Men's Big French Terry Hoodie, Sizes S-5XL","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently picked up the Athletic Works Men's and Men's Big French Terry Hoodie, and I have to say, it's been a pleasant surprise. While the hoodie is on the thinner side, it doesn't compromise on comfort. The fabric is soft and breathable, making it perfect for those slightly chilly days or for layering under a jacket.

One of the standout features for me is the fit. It provides a relaxed, comfortable feel without being too baggy. The hoodie also has a decent length, which is great for taller individuals or those who prefer a bit more coverage.

The design is simple yet stylish, making it versatile enough to wear for a casual day out or even for a quick workout session. The kangaroo pocket is a nice touch, providing a convenient place to keep your hands warm or store small items.

Overall, if you're looking for a lightweight, comfortable hoodie that doesn't break the bank, the Athletic Works Men's and Men's Big French Terry Hoodie is a solid choice. It may not be the thickest hoodie out there, but it definitely delivers on comfort and style.",5,8/17/2024,4.421052631578948

The pattern is adorable, the large pockets are both soft and cozy, and the hoot fits without being too snug.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the Reebok Delta Logo Fleece Hoodie and I couldn't be happier! The first thing that struck me was the incredible comfort. The fleece material is so soft against the skin, making it perfect for those chilly days or just lounging around at home. 

The hoodie fits true to size, and I appreciate that it comes in a range of sizes from S to 3XL, which ensures everyone can find their perfect fit. I opted for a large and it gives me enough room without being too baggy—just how I like my sweatshirts!

The design is another highlight. The Delta logo adds a sporty touch without being overwhelming, making it versatile enough to wear out casually or even during workouts. I've received several compliments on its style!

Additionally, it's really durable; after several washes, it has retained its shape and color beautifully with no pilling whatsoever.

Overall, this Reebok hoodie has quickly become one of my go-to pieces in my wardrobe. If you're looking for a cozy yet stylish sweatshirt that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",5,12/18/2024,4.7

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the Reebok Delta Logo Fleece Hoodie and I couldn't be happier! The first thing that struck me was the incredible comfort. The fleece material is so soft against the skin, making it perfect for those chilly days or just lounging around at home. 

The hoodie fits true to size, and I appreciate that it comes in a range of sizes from S to 3XL, which ensures everyone can find their perfect fit. I opted for a large and it gives me enough room without being too baggy—just how I like my sweatshirts!

The design is another highlight. The Delta logo adds a sporty touch without being overwhelming, making it versatile enough to wear out casually or even during workouts. I've received several compliments on its style!

Additionally, it's really durable; after several washes, it has retained its shape and color beautifully with no pilling whatsoever.

Overall, this Reebok hoodie has quickly become one of my go-to pieces in my wardrobe. If you're looking for a cozy yet stylish sweatshirt that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",5,12/18/2024,4.7

Fast forward to us opening a Wal-Mart box with multiple kid gear and it's her FAVORITE of the competition. i was impressed with the quality of the stitching and print on the hoodie. Also the colors are so subtle yet substantial.
The t-shirt is thicker than I asumed, and we love how it's designed longer in the back. The bold black writing pops appropriately and the graphic print is gritty to the touch but not inferior. The inside is soft to the skin.

My advice is to buy IN STORE and check the zippers, seams, and sleeve length because you never quite know what you'll receive via online. Finally, theres the irritation of having to haul a $10 item back to the store for a return because their online returns aren't working properly. I'm positive my time is worth way more than this.

On the other hand, I  will probaby keep it to wear around the house because it is warm for the freezing Winter nights.  So, if you're okay with that texture-- you will not mind.

I bough this one on a whim hoping there was something cool on the back and thankfully was not disappointed!  I normally wear an M but hate short midriff length on tops.

386,"Hanes Men's Explorer French Terry Lightweight Hooded Sweatshirt, Sizes XS-2XL","Lost one point for being “very stinky”. The french terry fabric also needs washing to soften it up. Consider washing before gifting. 

This is light-weight  for french terry. 

In my opinion, this would work well to throw on over a swimsuit at pool or beach to take away a too-early-in-the-morning outdoor swim class or late afternoon chill.  It is NOT winter weight— unless you are wintering in the Southern hemisphere. Good for about 60 degrees F, or warmer.

Color:

With that said, LOVE the blue.  I would say it is prettier than it looks on web page. Reminds me of a bright aqua blue popular at Easter time each year. Maybe let the “Easter Bunny” bring this next spring???

Sizing: 

Sizing seems accurate:  I bought a Small.
I am 5'7”, chest 36”, waist 29”, and usually long sleeves run short on me at wrists. This runs long  with wrist ribbing ends at my middle knuckles on fingers. Love that for warmth! Chest/ bust- wise, once on I had plenty of room.

Waist: I have about 5” extra on each side.

Do you have “heavier” upper arms? I have 11” upper arms.  On a Small, I have about 6” of extra room in this sweatshirt on each arm side.

Length of sweatshirt hits just below “crotch level.” That is why I was thinking this is a good length for a swimsuit cover up. 

Features:

Pockets are a pass- through “kangaroo” one long pocket- enter from each side.

Cute! The tips on the hood drawstrings are PINK! How unusual, this! For me, this really unusual feature will make this sweatshirt hard to part with.  

This sweatshirt is a winner.

Maybe the chemical odor is from the melted-sealed plastic bag it was packed in ???

Closing comment: The color is labeled “summer splash.” ( appropriate for swimsuit cover up). 

Hanes guarantees comfort according to tag—- but doesn't give a contact phone or email, and this was sold by Hanes it seems to a distributor “Consumer Services” then to a 3rd party seller who markets to / on Walmart. 

Not sure who guarantees quality - I am contacting Hanes about odor.",4,12/20/2024,4.2

The pattern is adorable, the large pockets are both soft and cozy, and the hoot fits without being too snug.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the Reebok Delta Logo Fleece Hoodie and I couldn't be happier! The first thing that struck me was the incredible comfort. The fleece material is so soft against the skin, making it perfect for those chilly days or just lounging around at home. 

The hoodie fits true to size, and I appreciate that it comes in a range of sizes from S to 3XL, which ensures everyone can find their perfect fit. I opted for a large and it gives me enough room without being too baggy—just how I like my sweatshirts!

The design is another highlight. The Delta logo adds a sporty touch without being overwhelming, making it versatile enough to wear out casually or even during workouts. I've received several compliments on its style!

Additionally, it's really durable; after several washes, it has retained its shape and color beautifully with no pilling whatsoever.

Overall, this Reebok hoodie has quickly become one of my go-to pieces in my wardrobe. If you're looking for a cozy yet stylish sweatshirt that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",5,12/18/2024,4.7

796,"Livhil Wearable Blanket Hoodie Sweater, Blanket Sweatshirt with Sleeves Blanket Hoodies for Women Girls and Kids, Plush Hoodie Blanket (Smile)","I got this mainly to use after a shower, instead of wearing a towel or maybe still being damp and getting dressed anyway. Even in the middle of the winter and in my only moderately heated bedroom, this warmed me up immediately. As a shorter woman of 5' 2"" the length is very good for me, going past my knees. The pattern is adorable, the large pockets are both soft and cozy, and the hoot fits without being too snug.
The only slightly annoying thing was that the tag says to wash and dry seperately before first use and tumble dry on low, which felt like it took forever because this holds a LOT of water. But, it was absolutely worth the wait for it to get dry.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the Reebok Delta Logo Fleece Hoodie and I couldn't be happier! The first thing that struck me was the incredible comfort. The fleece material is so soft against the skin, making it perfect for those chilly days or just lounging around at home. 

The hoodie fits true to size, and I appreciate that it comes in a range of sizes from S to 3XL, which ensures everyone can find their perfect fit. I opted for a large and it gives me enough room without being too baggy—just how I like my sweatshirts!

The design is another highlight. The Delta logo adds a sporty touch without being overwhelming, making it versatile enough to wear out casually or even during workouts. I've received several compliments on its style!

Additionally, it's really durable; after several washes, it has retained its shape and color beautifully with no pilling whatsoever.

Overall, this Reebok hoodie has quickly become one of my go-to pieces in my wardrobe. If you're looking for a cozy yet stylish sweatshirt that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",5,12/18/2024,4.7

1014,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Ecosmart Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirt, up to Size 5XL","The hoodie is kinda thin, the front bag is very delicate and might rip if you don't take care of it, I wouldn't recommend for a daily wear hoodie against extreme cold weather, I'd put it under a jacket so it can make a better style. But the hoodie itself (for me) it's not for daily use like another one that is more expensive and has better textile.",3,11/29/2024,4.4
1015,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Ecosmart Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirt, up to Size 5XL","This sweatshirt is okay, if I would have known I could get it in a front zip up style - I would not have purchased it though. After wearing it only 1 week - it's piling already.. (not the greatest quality. . .but it was cheep.)  If someone needed it for work- it would do . Especially since price was good.",3,1/6/2025,4.4

This amazing hoodie featuring Snoop Dogg is sure to be a crowd favorite. My son is wearing his size extra small, which is his normal size. This hoodie runs true to size and fits him perfectly.

I tried on the size small of this sweatshirt and it fit great. I would say it definitely fits more like men's sizing even though it's unisex.

1021,"Dogg Supply All Gender Snoop On A Stoop Christmas Graphic Hoodie Sweatshirt, Men's Sizes S-3XL","When I saw this I fell in love with it. It's fun, a little kitschy and features America's latest unexpected cultural icon. It fits true to size and the  quality is higher than I expected at Walmart.

It is a nice, heavyweight black hoodie. Very good quality! I love the Snoop elf graphic of him sitting on the dog house. The snowflakes next tonthe dog house and snowflake border on the top and bottom add a cute, festive touch. It is warm and cozy and comfortable to wear. The size Small fit me perfectly. For reference I am 5'3"" tall and around 130 pounds. I'd actually say this particular Dogg Supply hoodie runs a little smaller than some others we've purchased from the brand. A little less oversized. But I love the fit and I love Snoop on the Stoop and I definitely recommend.",5,1/30/2025,4.645833333333333

Forget about ugly sweaters, grab this hoodie and you can have your very own Snoop on the Stoop. You will be a hit every time you wear it! This is the size XL for men and women, and XL is my normal size in women's, so it is a little large, but since it is a sweatshirt, it works for me.

This fits but there should be a little more room in this size.  I am really confused by this sweatshirt. I have no clue what the words are behind the doghouse. The words are cut off by the picture.
