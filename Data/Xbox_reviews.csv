9,Microsoft Xbox Series S ‚Äì 1TB White,"Somehow, an unauthorized purchase of $74.99 was made on my card following this purchase. The amount posted from ""Xbox live"", but i did not purchase anything from Xbox Live. So I am unsure how they got my card information after I made this purchase with Walmart.

30,"Xbox Series S, 512GB SSD, All Digital Gaming Console, Robot White","I've Been An X-Box Gamer For Over 15 Years. I Purchased My Last X-BOX ONE Second Hand From WalMart  Over 5 Years Ago and It Just Kinked Out. This Time I Wanted To Upgrade and I Purchased The XBOX Series S, Not 2nd Hand But Brand New. What Can I Say About It? 'I Love It' and I Am Pleasantly Surprised at How Small It Is Compared To The XBOX ONE, Wow, The Casing Shrunk A lot. Takes Up Alot Less Room On My TV Stand.  Set Up Was A Breeze and Connection To My Internet Service Was as Quick As Me Typing In My Internet Password.  I Must Admit I Was A Bit Leary About Purchasing The X-BOX Series S In The Color White, Because All Of My Gaming Consoles Have Always Been Black. I Was Very Nervous About How It Would Look On My Black TV Stand. Surprisingly It Really Looks Good and It Is Aesthetically Pleasing To Me. I Don't Write Reviews Too Often, But I Had To Write A Review On My Purchase of The XBOX Series S Because Its' An Upgrade From My XBOX ONE. I Also Still Have My XVOX 360 Which I Also Purchased From WalMart Many Years Ago And It Still Works Like Its' Brand New.  Purchase Most Of My Electronic Gadgets From WalMart Because Whether I Purchase It Brand New or Used I Am NEVER Disappointed Because I Am On A Tight Budget The Prices Are Always Within My Price Range.

He absolutely LOVES it...though I now fear I may never get time alone with my husband again. lol. j/k. It's a great system. The S series is completely digital which has its pros and cons. The pros are everything can be bought through the Xbox store so we don't have to worry about having a collection of boxes for games.

This is really more of a burden than anything. I honestly wish I didn't get the Xbox because of this hitchhiker. Be careful when receiving a package from them. 

Aside from the Xbox, this console has amazing clean graphics. The console runs smoothly, meaning it's quiet. You don't even notice it's on! I don't have the best internet but it allows a smooth online play experience. Even with the size of it, due to the shape it is quite convenient to put on a shelf without it being too bulky. If your one to put down a controller and forgetting to turn it off, the controller will turn itself off automatically. Which will help you avoid to changing the batteries too often. Keep in mind this doesn't come with double AA rechargeable batteries; you will have to buy that separately. Also, you will need to buy a USB C cord to plug into the Xbox if you don't have batteries.

I am very happy with this purchase, and it came very fast! My only complaint is actually through FedEx and not through Walmart. It was one of those purchases where a delivery is required to sign, so I needed to make sure that someone was home. that's not always an option for me, so I was scared that I would miss delivery and have to make arrangements to pick it up.

205,Xbox Series S + Xbox Wireless Controller Robot White + 3 Month Game Pass,"okay to start off, i have no clue about xboxs and my sons are wanting a ps5 but i couldnt afford that right now so they were happy with an Xbox which is why i purchased it. like other ppl have mentioned it does require a signature so make sure you are home that day itll be delivered. they do let you know what day and when its in transit from local post office so i got mine around 4pm. it got delivered quicker than original time which was nice. like a few days earlier.i had read that a lot of people said they didnt get their extra controller. i opened mine to make sure i got mine and i couldnt find but one in the box by itself. so long story short i reached out to antonline told them i was missing it but turns out it was in there. i just panicked and didn't look good enough but under the brown cardboard in the box with the actual gaming system you will find the extra controller and cords. i think people didnt realize because it is hidden almost. they were very quick to respond. i did email and call twice before i got to speak to someone and he told me to look again and there it was. they were quick and friendly. so that was relief. if you are missing one walmart will do a refund once you return to store or however you want to return it. thank goodness i didnt have any issues. i turned it on and set it up to make sure it works before i wrap it up for Christmas and so far it seems great. i will update if any issues after Christmas but seems like a good deal and customer service seems to quick at responding by email and phone. i still am unsure on how to redeem the free gaming pass because i didnt see any card in the box so i think its automatically on the account once you create one. so all in all this seems like its worth the buy. just take your time at looking for the other remote because it should be in there under the brown cardboard that looks like its part of the box.",5,12/14/2023,4.5

442,"Microsoft Xbox One X 1TB Console, Black, CYV-00001","The programming in this version is just as buggy as the last. The Microsoft Edge doesn't exactly work like it should or you would want it to. There are still several glitches with the playing a videos on Facebook, perhaps or other websites that have automatic video play. Some of the programming for your File Explorer and your Photo viewing are still hinky.
There is no privacy setting on the Microsoft Edge that would prevent popups from coming up on your screen, adding new tabs. This would prevent unwanted sites from coming onto your Tab screen.
This creates a security issue.
Sometimes when I press my start button on my controller it doesn't start. And I sit two and a half feet away from the box and it refuses to start up when I press the button.
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good things about this. It produces high resolution video. It has the 4K video and a 1 terabyte drive. Some of the loading is faster, except for a few video games that I happen to play. I'm going to assume that it's the game itself that refuses to load that the game is glitching not the Xbox.

555,"Restored Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB Console, White (Refurbished)","$219.95 for a 1TB XBox One S is a great deal as I've been shopping online for a few weeks.

I gave it a 3 star because 1) Does not come with its own rechargeable batteries and charging cable. 2) It's so slow to install games from disc (40min for 25GB).  3) 1TB is not what you really get to use. Mine was 755GB that I could use. 4) Downloading updates are fast for me as I have 100MB of speed but installing those updates took about 20min. Reminds me of how Windows 10 installs updates. 5) The HDMI that comes with it only is a 1.4 which displays frame rates at 30. The XBox One S is made for HDMI 2.0 displaying frame rates at 60.

So it's a disappointment that I have to buy 3 more items to really complete this console but you can play it straight out of the box as it does come with its own HDMI cable and non-rechargeable batteries. And you may need to buy a bigger external SSD if you want more storage space.",3,1/12/2019,3.8

One star is way to high for the service I received. I ordered two of these bundles (XBOX, G920 steering wheel and Forza game) for my grandson and myself to play together after Christmas. I am still waiting to receive what I ordered. I have only received one XBOX and one G920. The shipper is hard to contact and Walmart customer service offered to refund me but then reneged saying I had received everything. So Walmart has my money, I have 2 out of 6 items and they are calling me a liar saying I received everything when I did not. I have tried to contact the shipper and when I get them on the phone they say they understand and that they will ship the missing parts but so far I am still waiting. I have never been so frustrated buying something in my life. This feels like elder abuse. Walmart's chat systems and phone numbers all seems to be there for Walmart to refuse to speak person to person to resolve problems. It is cheaper to hide behind automation and pass the buck to the shipper Walmart hired. All I want is what I ordered and paid for! I am beyond asking for or expecting for excellent customer service....just give me what I ordered or my money back.....This will cause me to never shop at Walmart again.

836,Microsoft Xbox Series X 1TB Carbon Black,"I ordered an Xbox Series X online on 12/11/2023 and I was delivered on 12/12/2023.  I was out of town so when I returned on 12/13/2023, I looked at the package and immediately thought, ""This is not an Xbox.""  When I opened it, it was a Beats Studio Headphones.  So I went to a Walmart to return it (they were kind and professional) and I spoked to a Coach who told me that I was at the incorrect Walmart.  He directed me to go to the Delta Shores Walmart in Elk Grove, California.  I proceeded to drive to that Walmart and spoke to an employee (Mery, she was kind and professional).  She called the Online Grocery Pick-up team and requested a Coach named Nitin, who kept saying that he was on his way and NEVER showed up.  I waited a while and an employee named Scott (who looked in over his head) showed up to talk to me.  Needless to say that I was growing with irritation.  Scott tried his best to answer my questions, but did not answer them to satisfactory.  I asked to speak to his manager and he informed me that he refuses to speak to customers.  Scott told me that they could not give me an Xbox and provided no solution whatsoever.  As I left Scott said, ""At least you got a free Beats Studio.""  Which I replied, ""That does not do me any good.  I want my Xbox.""  This so called Coach Nitin is a useless leader.  He does not deserve the promotion or title to lead employees.  Needless to say, I left angry with no resolve.  I called my cousin who is a Walmart employee and he directed me to call 1-800-924-9206.  I spoke to Alesha who helped me as best she can and told me to wait 48 hours for an email.  I even did a review and asked for a call back.  I waited for 48 hours and did not receive an email or a call back.  I called again and spoke to Ebony who was kind and professional.  I reluctantly agreed to send back the Beats Studio Headphones.  

I want to get a call back and I want what I paid for which is an Xbox Series X!!!",1,12/20/2023,4.7

1005,Xbox bundle: Microsoft Xbox Series X 1TB SSD Black Console and Wireless Controller + Watch Dogs: Legion and Assassin's Creed Valhalla+Ozeal Charging Station,"I've only had this laptop for a month so only time will tell if it's durable or not. I bought it to have an alternative to using my iPad and honestly it was just time to replace my old slow Toshiba (yes, they use to make laptops for personal use back in the day). This laptop is the perfect size and weight for me. I'm still setting things up, getting use to Windows 11 and removing a bunch of preloaded apps I don't need or want. Would have been nice if the keys were backlit but being that it's convertible, I can just use it like a tablet with the digital keyboard in low light. The touch screen is responsive (I didn't adjust the default setting). It doesn't have a number pad (which I didn't need or want) and I'm fine with the location of the power button. The trackpad is nice and large (I don't use a mouse). Beware, it can get hot and the fan can get loud at times but it's no worse than my Dell work laptop. I was able to easily hook up a second monitor using an HDMI to VGA Adapter. I bought and installed MS Office Home and Student 2021 separately (I didn't see a need to wait a month for it to arrive configured with software that can be downloaded in less than 30 minutes after purchase).
Now for the issues. I had to go online to figure out how to get my Cannon printer to be recognized. That was very frustrating but I finally found a thread where others had the same problem and offered a solution which actually worked. I still have not been able to setup hello sign-in using the fingerprint sensor. I've performed all the Windows software updates and followed most of the online recommendations for checking the biometric sensor driver (too afraid to uninstall and try to reinstall LOL) and I don't feel like fooling with an HP digital assistant.

1014,Restored Microsoft Xbox 360 Slim 4GB Video Game Console Matching Black Controller HDMI (Refurbished),"I bought this console again due to the fact Microsoft has not allowed all Xbox 360 games to become backwards compatible so you would need an Xbox 360 in order to play these games. I live in an apartment complex so I get my packages stolen all the time from UPS, FedEx, Amazon, etc. 

I emailed this company: Voomwa. To inform them of the possible issues I have been facing for a while. I ordered this January 5th through Affirm which was really helpful. I got this order 2 hours before I got ready to leave town on on January 7th. It does show and state at least 2 weeks before shipping but I am sure it wouldn't take them long to send your items. 

About the product!? I got the console (like-new) even though it says refurbished. 

It came with a controller, power supply box, I was looking for the AV color cords but instead it had an HDMI cord which I did not use when I had my old one back in 2012. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A HARD DRIVE PLEASE BE ADVISED AND HAVE YOUR OWN AND BUY ONE!! 

This console takes a internal hard drive up to 500GB. I had my 250GB hard drive since 2012 when I lost my console and kept it in the year of 2021 and had so much stuff on it I forgot that was even mine.

I ordered the Starfield bundle but did not receive the digital code for the game.

The ""customer service"" line was basically just a voicemail box so I never could actually talk to anyone and all my other messages through Wal-Mart have also been ignored.

Finally got it and it's been great! Graphics big difference than my Xbox one. I am in Texas it took about 5 days to get here. I was worried about FedEx dropping it off on the road by my house and not at the front door. That has been happening a lot with my packages shipped by FedEx. When it was shipped you can request it be delivered to a onsite FedEx and they notify you when it's available for pickup. That's what I ended up doing rather than taking off work to be available for it to come in. Pick up was easy it got a text when it was ready. Xbox works great! Very impressed no issues!
