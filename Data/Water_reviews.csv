0,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","Thank you so much for supporting our Veterans.  My father who is 92 years old now served in the Korean War so, this really is personal to me.  In the past, we had purchased PureLife water but, most recently because I was having challenges getting cases of Walmart's Great Value Cases of Water, we purchased it again.  I truly believe everything happens for a reason and, we will make PureLife Water a part of our commitment now.  I drank a bottle and was reminded of why we purchased it in the past.  Our family are Fans of the best way for Healthy Hydration, PureLife Purified Water.",5,9/3/2024,3.4
1,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)",So I honestly feel a bit silly writing a review about water but here it goes.. I will say I enjoy the taste of Nestle water. The problem with the product lies within the way the bottles are made. I can appreciate the company trying to cut back on plastic usage however these bottles are so thin and flimsy they don't stand up straight on a flat surface. I thought at first I received a case that was maybe crushed or damaged but upon further inspection realized that was not the issue. The bottles lean sideways from the middle and don't stand up straight on the counter or in the fridge. They easily topple and spill which is quite the pain and inconvenience. I probably won't buy this brand of bottled water again.,3,5/21/2024,3.4
2,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","I've bought this brand of water twice. Both times because Deer Park wasn't available to me, but about a year apart. Both times I got them, the bottles were so damaged on the bottoms that they won't stand up on their own. You can't even force them to stand up. You have to either lay them down or lean them up against something. I put this one in a cup to take the picture. I don't know if they make them this way on purpose or not. What are the odds that I'd get a bunch of bottles all warped on the bottoms both times I bought them and a year apart from each other? Like, it wasn't just one damaged lot, but seems to be the way they make them.",2,7/12/2024,3.4
3,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","I had ordered (2) 35 bottle deer park water bottles  but I guess they were out. I was asked by shopper about my replacement Pure Life, I couldn't respond because there was a technical issue on the Walmart app. I wasn't happy with the selection of Pure Life Purified Water, I had rather gotten a refund to buy what I like the next time, since 35 Deer Park was out of stock.",2,6/29/2024,3.4
4,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","I had to switch brands away from Pure Life Purified Water. The plastic bottles are made with a very thin plastic material. The last three cases I bought had the bottoms distorted so bad they would not even stand up. I had to pour the water into a class. Also, the neck on some bottles were bent so bad the lid was touching the side of the bottle. Some bottles came without a label wich to me is a red flag for tampering so I had to pour the water down the drain. I will never buy this brand of bottled water again.",1,10/24/2024,3.4
5,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","II asked items to be delivered to the door. They were left at the bottom of 8 steps not on porch. The water is still setting in driveway. And will stay there until I can get someone to carry it in. If it had been left on my porch I could have opened it and carried in a few at a time. I am 70 and have had back surgery. 
Thank you",1,6/23/2024,3.4
6,"Pure Life Purified Water, 16.9 Fl Oz / 500 mL, Plastic Bottled Water (35 Pack)","Arrived at the store at 11:35 . 
Someone brought out ONE case of water and placed it in my trunk .  I told him that i purchased 6 cases of water . He then asked to see my online receipt online .he then proceeded to say that he was going inside to get the rest of the water . I then watched multiple men bring out 8 curbside orders not including my order . 
I called the curbside number and told them that i was still waiting , it wasn't until i asked to speak to a manager that my water was brought out . I had been parked since 11:35 !

13,"OZARKA Brand 100% Natural Spring Water, 16.9-ounce plastic bottles (Pack of 35)",The Ozarka bottled waters have definitely gone down in quality. The plastic bottles themselves are not as durable as they use to be. The water levels are inconsistent. The caps almost fall off as soon as you start to open them. The labels don’t have enough glue and are falling off as well. My family has bought Ozarka for years - like since my 25-year-old was little.  This product is definitely not the same anymore.,2,2/1/2023,3.2
14,"OZARKA Brand 100% Natural Spring Water, 16.9-ounce plastic bottles (Pack of 35)",I  DID NOT Receive my Ozarka spring water and I would like you to deliver me a 35 bottle of Ozarka Spring water or REFUND my purchase price of $6.98   tax to my bank card.

20,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack",I cannot express strongly enough that I am angry when Walmart keeps changing their prices for this product up or down $1.00.

21,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack",I buy this water for my son 4/6 cases at a time he likes the extra health benefits and taste.  He is a delivery driver and in this heat he drinks a lot of water.  The cost too is better than any other store and they deliver it within 5-10mins  by delivery time.  Please try this water it really does make a difference it's not just hype.,5,9/28/2024,4.0
22,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack","I thought I really liked Dasani until I started putting it in my Keurig. I noticed a distinct difference of this water versus other filtered reverse osmosis tap water. it seems they add all kinds of chlorides. It noticeably changed the taste of my dark roast coffee. 

Ruins a perfectly good cup of coffee. 
Perhaps the chlorides are beneficial after a good run or other exercise. 
But to open my eyes with it, not so much. 

Don't get me started on the price. ALL bottled water is guilty of this.",4,9/20/2024,4.0

24,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack","Wow. They messed up everything. The bottle itself is OK, but I miss that it doesn't have a neck. The bottle cap is ridiculous. You try to close the cap, and the threading slips. There is absolutely no way to tighten the cap after opening and the water leaks out. I accidentally dropped the bottle of water on the floor and water squirted out into my eye at work. But the worst part about this is the old Dasani flavor is gone; before it had a refreshing, almost sweet taste to it from the minerals. Now it tastes like metal and dirt. Whoever approved all of these changes should be fired. I will never buy this again. I'll go to another product that has a regular bottle cap size. It's not that I don't want to save on excess plastic, but if I can't close my water bottle for transport, what's the point. These thin caps are for the birds.",1,10/30/2024,4.0
25,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack",NOT as pictured. I spent more money on Desani water because the bottles shown are more study. But the ones that came as as hunky and thin as the great value ones. So I should have saved my money and just bought the junky ones. It seems you cant get decent bottles anymore unless its a $2 - $3 dollar a bottle water.,1,10/4/2024,4.0

27,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack","I guess Dasani thought they were going to be clever and switch to the cheapest, most flimsy bottles I have ever seen in my life. I wish I could have given them zero rating! You even hold these bottles in your hand and they crumble! And the little tiny caps they put on them are so cheap, it's not funny. I cannot believe they have stooped this low to give their customers these lowest quality flimsy plastic bottles, that you just know are going to leak some of that plastic into the water! I will never buy from them again. They should know that when you mess with quality you lose customers! I could not be more displeased.",1,12/28/2022,4.0
28,"Dasani Purified Water Bottles, 16.9 fl oz, 32 Pack","I would suggest you avoid this garbage product. The cap and bottle are so cheap if you pick up a bottle and squeeze it to hard the cap flies off and you get soaked. The caps are also one time use only, they do not go back on after you open the bottle. Also, the cap is so small the bottle is hard to open.  Very infuriating example of the how cheap can we make this product trend going on now.

The driver delivered nine cases of water to me and they were piled allover my doorstep....the receipt says ten which is also off....I ordered one case of twelve bottles, was delivered nine cases and charged for ten cases...I will keep them since I do drink a lot of water and also give bottled water to my dogs on occasion but I didn't need 9 cases, for %2633.80 when I expected to pay $3.18 for one case.

Ruins a perfectly good cup of coffee. 
Perhaps the chlorides are beneficial after a good run or other exercise.

You try to close the cap, and the threading slips. There is absolutely no way to tighten the cap after opening and the water leaks out. I accidentally dropped the bottle of water on the floor and water squirted out into my eye at work. But the worst part about this is the old Dasani flavor is gone; before it had a refreshing, almost sweet taste to it from the minerals. Now it tastes like metal and dirt. Whoever approved all of these changes should be fired. I will never buy this again. I'll go to another product that has a regular bottle cap size.

I will say I enjoy the taste of Nestle water. The problem with the product lies within the way the bottles are made. I can appreciate the company trying to cut back on plastic usage however these bottles are so thin and flimsy they don't stand up straight on a flat surface. I thought at first I received a case that was maybe crushed or damaged but upon further inspection realized that was not the issue. The bottles lean sideways from the middle and don't stand up straight on the counter or in the fridge. They easily topple and spill which is quite the pain and inconvenience.

439,Clear American 1L Blue Raspberry,I listed a substitution just in case…..somehow ended up with something totally different?  I chose a substitute flavor for each flavor of bottled water that I ordered. Somehow I ended up with blue raspberry. I buy the same three flavors every week. Couple weeks ago I ended up with peach when I didn't order it. What's the point in selecting a substitute flavor if the shopper is just going to give me whatever flavor they feel like giving me?  Am I now expected to take these bottles of water back to the store?  Or just throw them out and take a loss?  I'm going to select “do not replace” in the future.,1,1/3/2024,4.2

When you call you either get an answering machine or some service representative on so.e island or in Africa. I am thinking about closing my account.

I love this water. To me, all the other brands that I've tried taste like (clean) tap water. However, Core has a nice, almost sweet taste to it — presumably from the minerals. Whenever I need bottled water, it's now my go-to brand.

I only have two criticisms: the price and the water level. For whatever reason, the bottles are filled right up to the very top. It's not a big deal, but, if you forget, there‘a a good chance of spilling it. However, it's better than under-filling the bottles — like some brands do.
