27,ADQ Men's Slip on Shoes Casual Shoes Lightweight Breathable Anti-Slip Sneakers,These are a ultra lightweight shoe but useless for every day use in almost any way.

49,"Totes Men's Moraine Winter Boots, Sizes 8-13, Wide Width Available","When I first got these boots I thought they looked sharp. I tried them on, they were very comfortable. Then I noticed something that surprised me and turned me off immediately. Does anybody else see it in the picture? Then let me tell you if you missed it. It's designed with the tongue not attached to the shaft.
One step in a slushy puddle deeper than two inches and your feet will be soaked.
I've never seen a snow boot made like this before. It's very disappointing because I like them, but they're going back.",2,1/23/2025,3.9

52,"Totes Men's Moraine Winter Boots, Sizes 8-13, Wide Width Available",The material is pretty cheap.  The laces on one of the boots snapped the second time I went to lace them up.  The laces on the other one are about to snap too.   The seam is coming apart too after only worn three times. I'm not super active either.  I bought them 2 sizes bigger than what I wear so that there would be room for my orthotics to fit inside but they barely fit my feet without the orthotics.,1,1/15/2025,3.9
53,VONMAY Unisex Slides Sandals Soft Thick Sole Non-Slip Pillow Sandals,Very  nice quality super comfortable but size up to your next half size if possible because if you get your exact size your toes will be snug at top hitting the edge I think sizing up is a perfect fit.

54,VONMAY Unisex Slides Sandals Soft Thick Sole Non-Slip Pillow Sandals,"What I love most about these is that they have a very soft cushiony sole.. I can wear them barefoot or with socks. I am usually size 8, and the W7/8 fit well. When I wear them for longer walks, I do get some irritation in my bunion area, but for just around the house or short walks they are great!",5,11/19/2024,4.2
55,VONMAY Unisex Slides Sandals Soft Thick Sole Non-Slip Pillow Sandals,these shoes are very cushioning like walking on air not as sturdy as the NOBO slides from walmart.  I'll probably keep them but I ordered a smaller size 7/8 wide instead of a nine wide.  my only complaint is the top is loose fitting and is not a snug across the foot as I like.,4,8/10/2024,4.2
56,VONMAY Unisex Slides Sandals Soft Thick Sole Non-Slip Pillow Sandals,"Delivery guy left my slides in front of someone else's house and I had to spend nearly a week twisting arms just to get a refund for the mistake that WALMART made. Went into the store to pick up a pair in person and these slides were mad comfy and they've got some fat cushion soles. If you're gonna buy a pair, I advise not getting it shipped",4,10/17/2024,4.2

Would not recommend.",1,11/1/2023,4.2
59,VONMAY Unisex Slides Sandals Soft Thick Sole Non-Slip Pillow Sandals,"I have one foot 9-1/2 and one foot 10-1/2, so I buy size 11 in these inexpensive shoe/slippers and it seems to work, but THIS time, the 10-1/2 foot fit well while the 9-1/2 foot was too large for the slipper.  Both seem to be of the same size (44-45 on soles) but  I'd need a larger slipper to work with the smaller foot.  Also, and probably due to the fit, I was very unstable on the slippers and am really disappointed in them.  Buy with caution- if you have a high instep, they probably won't fit well. 

Great VOLS orange, tho'!",1,10/11/2023,4.2

He settled on the red for Christmas. Once they arrived the red is more of a dark maroon color. Not at all like shown. He says they are comfortable and loves them no matter the color. I knew I should have stuck with my gut and got him the dark blue. Just be aware the red it not a true red, it's a very dark maroon. I would NOT pay full price for these either. They are nice %26 comfy however the stitching is off on my grey pair inside the toe part on the right slipper making a lump. Not worth sending them back for.

The size I received is a lot bigger than expected so my daughter won't be able to wear them for a while.

I believe I have 10 pair every time a new color or pattern comes out I must have.  What makes me come back to this shoe is the cushion inside the shoe and the support the shoe gives my foot.  I have yet to break the cushion down in these shoes.

I started wearing Avia in 1995 I had a job that allowed us to dress down on the weekend tennis shoes shorts etc.  I needed a pair of shoes that I could keep clean I chose Avia over Nike number one reason the cushion in the shoe every step I walked I could feel the bumps in the asphalt I just had reconstructed knee surgery and I had to wear a CTi brace for a year to keep my knee cap in place having that extra cushion in the Avia shoe was the best.  When Avia parent company Reebok discontinued all Avia products because Avia out sold Reebok I was lost trying to find a comfortable shoe was crazy I tried Skechers and Nike but the cushion in the shoe was not there.  When Walmart started selling Avia shoes I was happy I was worried how long they would considering the price but the fit was the best my weird foot a size 6 with a wide width and a triple A heal I have no problem with my foot stretching out the shoe or my heal popping and getting blisters.

186,Dumajo Kids Sneakers for Boys Running Shoes Lightweight Sport (Toddler/Little Kid/Big Kid),"First, the shoe is not sized appropriately. The sizing is actually not-standard-US sizing, so someone has tried to convert it. Alleged to be a size 13 and 1/2 (which is nowhere indicated on the shoe), it is more like a 1 and 1/2. Second, the shoe is not nearly as heavy or durable as expected. When you bend the shoe, it creaks, the kind of sound you would hear trying to bend something that is very dried out. Third, the color is not nearly as vibrant as shown in the pictures. The blue spills over onto the sole (which looks kind of ridiculous) and the blue coloring on the side does not even cover the edge of the sole, The picture is very deceiving as the coloring does not go up that high and is not sharp at all.

222,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Clogs,"Honestly, I've seen a few of these reviews and people keep on saying how it's cutting their foot open and all the other stuff.

224,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Clogs,The clogs were very cute in nice colors. My only complaint is that they are not very comfortable on the top of my foot. I have a high arch foot so maybe that's why the tops were really digging into my foot? IDK but they are only used for around the house bc waking for long periods would really hurt.,4,1/18/2025,4.1
225,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Clogs,Size up especially if you are wearing socks with them. These shoes run about a half size too small but are comfortable but I wish I had gotten a larger size.

227,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Clogs,They're okay for what they are. The  glue on the sides of the shoe started coming on and separating the top fabric from the base.

228,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Clogs,I am normally a size 7 shoe and reading reviews I read to size up.. sized up to a 8 and I think I'd need a 8.5 since my foot goes all the way to the back of the shoe! but they don't have half sizes. I have never in my life wore 8.5-9 in any shoes EVER. I'd recommend going to a store that has them and trying them on before buying. disappointed the store wouldn't take them back because I tried them on walked around my house for 5 seconds to see if they would be okay since my foot was so close to the backing and it just was not comfortable so I went to exchange them and they wouldn't.,2,12/3/2024,4.1
229,"No Boundaries Women's Twin Gore Canvas Slip On Sneakers, Wide Width Available",I reviewed the black. Love them so purchased the white. Am equally happy with them.

233,"No Boundaries Women's Twin Gore Canvas Slip On Sneakers, Wide Width Available","No Boundaries Women's Twin Gore Canvas Slip-On Sneakers Review

The No Boundaries Women's Twin Gore Canvas Slip-On Sneakers are an okay choice for casual footwear, especially considering their affordability. They fit well and are convenient to slip on, making them great for quick outings.

However, the material used for the upper or the stitching around the top of the foot can feel a bit itchy, which might cause some discomfort during extended wear. I suspect it has to do with the fabric or stitching used. If you're looking for budget-friendly shoes for short-term use, they're fine, but they might not be the best for all-day comfort.",3,1/20/2025,4.3

I had to buy a 9 to get the boot on but once my foot was in there was so much shoe I couldn't cover because I'am an ""8"" the clogs were 8 because they were slip on but because the top of the shoe was so tight I couldn't keep them on..mind you my foot fits, its the flexibility of the top of the shoe..super stiff and unmoving.",2,11/23/2024,4.3

I feel like I will only be able to wear these for short periods of time because I will stay feeling my big toe uncomfortable crammed in a shoe half size smaller. With this said, if you are a half size, go up to the next. Better for the shoe to fit slightly big but comfortable than small and cause you ingrown nails or something because its too tight. Aside from this these Hello Kitty sneakers are super cute %26 for $10 girl it was a bargain for sure! They look to be well made and I would definitely buy again but a size 10 this time. The only reason I wont return these is because I am already a big foot woman and at a size 9 these already make my foot look big as it is so imagine a size 10!?

This is now the third size i've bought in a year and she hasn't worn out any of them because she doesn't wear them often enough... that said, sometimes you just need a plain black dress shoe and this does the job.  cheap enough to buy in every size and not cry too much if they only wore them twice.",4,10/10/2024,4.6

I purchased the Red/White and while they're super cute and fit true to size, the color was horrible.  The “white” wasn't even close to white, it was more medium cream and looked yellowed.

Wide enough for my feet %26 they seem super comfortable! There's room for an extra insole if I wanted to add one - the insoles are not glued down which I love, since my chiropractor suggests slipping 3/4 length insoles “under” the built-in insoles in shoes to prevent them sliding around. My bestie sent me a TikTok where someone said these are comparable to Hoka Bondi's or whatever and I think they'll be at least amazing for a $23 walking shoe!! Definitely worth the $$",5,2/1/2025,4.7

Very pleased.",5,9/24/2024,4.4
345,Athletic Works Women's Lifestyle Mesh Jogger Sneakers,"Athletic Works Medium width shoes (mine in size 7 1/2) from Walmart are light -weight, but fairly sturdy, are breathable, have a decent foam (glued down) insert, and are clearly a good value. I purchased them in black (these ran the longest), blue (slightly shorter), black %26 white (even slightly shorter or tighter than the blue), and all white (the shortest and tightest of all).  I can wear size 7 if the shoes run big, and 8 if my 3/4 orthotic makes the 7.5 too tight.  I purchased the black pair of Athletic Works sneakers at the store after determining that they seemed supportive enough for cutting grass, and then tried the other colors (ordered on-line one at a time) because the shoes are firm enough on the sides to provide the ankle support that I need.  I can wear my 3/4 orthotic in all of the shoes, although just barely in the white ones. The white shoes run about 1/4 size shorter/smaller than the all-black ones.  The shoes do also come in wide width. If you have a full-length orthotic you might need to go up one size to ensure a good fit as the padded insole of the shoe is not removable. These shoes do not have the same quality memory foam that many name brands do, but for the cost do provide adequate foam needed for comfort. For a softer landing you could go up a size and add an additional, softer insert if more comfort is needed. For the price, these shoes (and the men's shorts in the same line) provide good quality for the cost, and are reasonably attractive. If you are too brand conscious to wear them out and about, perhaps you could consider purchasing a pair to wear in the home or for yard work. Your wallet will be happy if you do! 😊",4,10/8/2024,4.4

I got my correct size and my tires are getting to push out the top and i can FEEL the concrete under my feet as if I had no shoes on.  3. They're really ugly in person.  They look like clown shoes which is odd considering they're not BIG on me. They are very narrow in the middle and then the front and top is wider, it looks so weird.  I'm SO glad I didn't get multiple colors like I planned.  And I get that they were cheap but I don't even get the BOX for them? You buy something BRAND NEW then it should come in it's original packaging. No,  it was shoved in a bag. And that's exactly how it's going back - in the same exact bag they sent it to me in.  I'm gonna take a picture right now - looking down at my feet.  These look like they're DEF gonna get really dirty really fast.  Not worth it... even if they were $5.

The back of this shoe isn't stiff cardboard like this year's Time and Tru Mary Janes, however if this is something that bothers you I recommend getting moleskin tape for blisters which is also sold at walmart. Regarding sizing though, these are true to size BUT you will see right away that they are a little narrow.

The inside is cushioned on the bottom of the foot with memory foam, but the rest of the shoe (the sides and top) is stiff against the foot. It is a canvas material that feels rough. Also, if you wear a bigger shoe size; I do not recommend this- only because it looks longer and wider than most other shoes, and makes my size appear even bigger than it is. I may still wear these sometimes, but probably not as an everyday shoe (as I planned upon purchase).",3,10/22/2024,4.2

HOWEVER, I've bought them for $10 and I am going to use for walking all over Europe this Spring.  They are super comfy and I love the built up heel.  For me, it's more comfortable walking all day with somewhat of a built up heel.  They are very stylish and I've decided to take instead of a much more expensive pair of runners.  They look great with jeans to dress trousers to casual dresses.",5,1/24/2025,4.4

They are comfy to wear from minute get dressed till bed with staying on my feet for 10  hours. The real traction is so worth it, it makes it better in snow or nice dry ground to cement. My feet and legs don't hurt and no slipping from the now felt and smooth bottoms of so many sneakers out there that are sold by many brands (expensive ones too!).

The sole looks normal, but it has a distinct feel that it was assembled with cheap glue. The inside is cushioned on the bottom of the foot with memory foam, but the rest of the shoe (the sides and top) is stiff against the foot. It is a canvas material that feels rough. Also, if you wear a bigger shoe size; I do not recommend this- only because it looks longer and wider than most other shoes, and makes my size appear even bigger than it is.

My only ""issue"" is that these shoes are so popular that every time I try to order another pair they are out of stock in my size!  I wear a wide width in these shoes, but they are almost a little snug - I feel like these shoes run a little on the small side.  Hopefully they will stretch out with extended use.

582,Rugged Shark Toddler & Big Boys Eva Clogs,These shoes are very stiff and uncomfortable. My son refuses to wear them because they're so stiff. They definitely aren't the material that you'd expect for croc knockoffs.,3,10/13/2024,4.6
583,Rugged Shark Toddler & Big Boys Eva Clogs,"These were listed OR selling and sitting beside shoes that were CROCS, and they said CROCS on the side of them, obviously, they just looked similar, but in that aspect, that's what I thought I was purchasing. Very disappointed.",2,12/6/2024,4.6
584,Rugged Shark Toddler & Big Boys Eva Clogs,"While I have little experience buying kids' shoes, these are massive. The choices were little kid and big kid. Having an older little kid, I chose the bigger size of little kid shoes and got a full-on BIG, adult size shoe. These are neither baby, toddler, nor child shoes.",1,12/15/2024,4.6

587,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,"Got the ""Athletic Works Lightning Bolt Light Up Play Sneakers""  in red color, size 1. They were clearance priced online for $7, a steal being they are light up, littles always love that feature! The bonus is that each shoe has a power on/off button, so the light up feature can be turned off if desired. I've noticed the power button is the new trend in light up shoes lately,  I'm assuming it prolongs the battery life of the lights, or maybe just allows turning off if needed in certain settings, or your child decides they're too old for lights but still like the shoe design... idk, but it's a nice touch for sure! Might help avoid the dreaded one shoe light going out before the other, I remember that happening when my oldest was still into light up shoes... My son is almost 6, wears a little bit larger shoe for his age, in comparison to the sizing chart suggestion. Normally wears a 13, but I got a size up (youth size 1) since 13 was out of stock. They fit his wide feet really well, and he still has room to grow! Thought they might be a bit too big yet, I was going to stick them up in the closet for a few more months, boy grows like a weed! Although they're, truly at least half, if not a whole  size too large, the velcro straps secure them to his feet enough that he felt comfortable in them, and didn't want to wait. He loves the black and red colors, says the lightening bolts make him look like ""Shadow"" (from Sonic the Hedgehog) when he runs, lol! Overall, they are great shoes, and for what I paid, a very fair price! Even at the regular $25, I would buy them, seeing as how much he liked them and they're wide enough and don't rub or hurt his feet. We'll see how long the lights and designs last, but I think he'll outgrow them before that happens. They also have odor control memory foam, which is great for active boys who might have sweaty feet. The only downsides I can think of, both shoes had a couple of minor strings frayed in the stitches, nothing major, a quick snip or hitting them with a lighter flame for just a second, and good as new. The glue around the bottom seams and sole isnt perfect, but who's looking that close. Nice shoes, thank you Athletic Works and Walmart!",5,1/25/2025,4.5
588,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,"Here is my 5-year old grandsons review: wow,for me? I then got a leg hug, he put them on and ran around my house. stopped and told me the (lightning) bolts made him go faster. They are nice looking and do light up but the button to turn off the lights is tricky and doesnt always work. I still gave them 5 stars because they are pretty rugged, great price and my grandson will out grow them before he can destroy them.",5,10/9/2024,4.5
589,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,"The lights with on/off switch is so much fun!
My 4 year old grandson was ecstatic when he put them on.
I'm not sure how I'll clean them but the smile on his face is worth every penny!!!",5,12/21/2024,4.5
590,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,I could not believe how nice these shoes were and made out of great material and they even light up on each side! Great price as well! Wish they had other colors …I would have ordered each color!😍,5,1/17/2025,4.5
591,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,My 5 year old son is all excited to wear this and watch in the mirror as the bottom lights up. He says its his super power with every step and now he can go faster. Perfect fit and it is supportive by the ankle for when he is running.,5,1/18/2025,4.5
592,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,"The sneakers were good except one didn't light up, that was very disappointing, especially for the sneaker recipient. Maybe the store associate could have checked if both sneakers lit up before running them out to my car.",4,1/16/2025,4.5
593,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,These were very cute and a great value for the price. The problem is only ONE shoe actually lit up. My 3 year old was very disappointed. We were on a vacation when I i bought these so I i couldnt return them to the store. They ended up in the trash. It was a shame.,1,1/11/2025,4.5
594,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,The light power buttons were on the wrong side. We had to find the buttons ourselves and they weren't on the correct side. (Almost as if the “cover” of the shoes were put on backwards) Then these shoes only lasted a week. The lights stopped working and the soles started falling off.,1,12/30/2024,4.5
595,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,These are poorly made. Everything was made poorly (the lights on one shoe stopped after one week) the buttons to turn them on and off were on the incorrect side of the shoe and were hard to find. (As if the she'll or outside of the shoe was on backwards) these also had holes in them within a month.,1,12/30/2024,4.5
596,Athletic Works Little & Big Boys Lightning Bolt Light-up Play Sneakers,Product is narrow and difficult to fit toddler foot in. Also one shoe won't light up at all and my toddler was in tears. Have to buy another shoe to offset his disappointment.,1,10/30/2024,4.5
597,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"Super cute flat!   The olive green color with the gold buckle is so cute and dressy!   The shoe is surprisingly comfortable.   I typically wear an 8 to an 8.5, and these fit perfectly!",5,1/28/2025,4.6
598,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"My normal size is 9. In this shoe 9 was too big. I will order an 8 1/2 and hope the toe box is not too narrow as this shoe does have a narrow toe. 

Very cute, on trend shoe that looks more exspensive than the price tag.",5,1/14/2025,4.6
599,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,These are very stylish and comfortable. Someone said they look like Sam Edelman's and I love their shoes so I was of course intrigued and I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.,5,1/20/2025,4.6
600,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"Super cute loafers. I was nervous as they only have whole sizes, I normally wear 8.5  but I took a chance and went with an 8 and it's a good fit. Will definitely use a protectant spray and avoid wearing in the rain but a great shoe!",5,1/1/2025,4.6
601,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,Absolutely gorgeous they fit perfectly. They look expensive and they feel good. Absolutely gorgeous they fit perfectly. They look expensive and they feel good.,5,1/8/2025,4.6
602,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,So glad I got these before they sell out. Gorgeous color with a nice brushed buckle that makes it look way more expensive than it is. I bought the green and the raffia and already have them paired with so much in my closet.,5,2/5/2025,4.6
603,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"Love the color and style of this loafer. While they are not a high end purchase, will be fine for the style and color. Runs a bit narrow but I will use a shoe stretcher to alleviate that. Good value",4,1/31/2025,4.6
604,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"I have multiple pairs of Time and Tru loafers in size 8, so naturally I ordered an 8. They are very tight. They are super cute and I want so badly for them to fit, especially since they are out of stock. Sadly I will have to return them.",4,2/5/2025,4.6
605,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,These shoes are beautiful!  They didn't work for me too narrow in the toe box for me.   My right foot is a little bigger due to injury.  They could work for you.,3,1/21/2025,4.6
606,Time and Tru Women's Buckle Loafer,"The fabric/material is cheap and gets dirty very quickly. But these shoes are comfortable. However, I don't believe these shoes will last long.",3,1/19/2025,4.6

608,AND1 Men’s Backcut Basketball High-Top Shoes,"I really love the AND1 brand.  Its hard to find high top sneakers at a reasonable price.  And these are really excellent.  I got my first pair about 3 years ago at Walmart on sale in the store.  And they fit great, felt great, last a long time (I still use them, though they now have a hole in the heal forming).  I used them regularly for gym workouts and a 1.5 mile walk/run to get to the gym.  
When I noticed these wearing out, I bought a few more pairs online.  I have only started using the royal blue ones, but they are great.  I use them for the same purpose as described above, and a little more for knock arounds as needed.
A couple of notes.
1.  I bought mine a little large.  This is so I can put a good insole into them. Fits like a glove, and feels great!
2.  I bought a few different colors.  Not being able to see them in person, and only online; the colors and trim are slightly different than my expectation.  Not a big issue; typical of buying things online.
3.  These are really functional for my purpose.  If you are looking for the most stylish sneakers, these probably arent the right ones for you.  But if you want a good true fit, high top, good quality, functional sneaker, these are great.
4.  Even the laces are great.  My original pair, still has the original laces.",5,1/7/2025,4.7
609,AND1 Men’s Backcut Basketball High-Top Shoes,"Without width selection, I ordered the shoes online. They came quickly and at a great price. They are very  comfortable and I am ordering another pair in a different color.",5,10/23/2024,4.7

612,AND1 Men’s Backcut Basketball High-Top Shoes,"Ordered online. There was no width selection. Disappointed that they came with patent leather. Not my style.

617,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,I love the shape/style of this boot.  I wasn't sure if it would be something I'd wear but I was pleasantly surprised at the style and fit of this boot.  The memory foam makes is comfortable and I know I'll be able t wear this all day at a music festival.,5,10/7/2024,4.7
618,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,"I ordered these on a Black Friday Deal. They were marked down from $40 to $20. I had every expectation that I would be returning them. I was so pleasantly surprised. I wore them to church on Sunday. It was a long day, and I was shocked at how comfortable they were. 

Hopefully, they will hold up, but for the price, I dont feel overly stressed about it.",5,11/26/2024,4.7
619,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,I'm usually always a size 7.5 but in boots I size up to an 8. The 8 fit perfectly even with socks on. The color is perfect and so is the height! I love where it hits on my legs. I searched about 8-10 pairs and decided on these. Price is great. 10/10 would recommend!,5,10/29/2024,4.7
620,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,These boots are gorgeous! I love the stitching and the pointy toe. Just a lovely boot. I found they run a tiny bit big but one could wear a thick sock with them since they don't come in half sizes. I wish the heel height was a bit more but overall these are great.,5,9/23/2024,4.7
621,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,"Very well made boots.  They look like leather and have excellent stitching.  Soles are comfortable, heel is undershot. I like the zippers because they make it so much easier to get them on and off.  The only thing that is a drawback is the small diameter shaft. If you have muscular calves they're tight.  I would buy them again even so.  Overall a great boot.",5,1/9/2025,4.7
622,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,"I like these boots. The heel is low making them comfortable.  I normally wear a 6.5, but I usually go up a half size in all boots. I purchased these in a size 7 and
they actually fit like a 6.5, therefore making them not true to size. I will have to wear very thin socks with these. This is my only reason for rating these boots with 4 stars and not 5.",4,10/25/2024,4.7
623,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,"These boots are adorable and a really good value. I have wider calves and unfortunately they did not fit comfortably or look right so I returned them. I ordered my normal size, 9, and they did fit well in the foot. If your calves are smaller to normal, these could work well for you.",4,10/23/2024,4.7
624,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,I've been looking for some western boots for awhile and bought these in the black and light brown/beige based on the great reviews. I'm a true 7.5 but got an 8 so I can wear thicker socks if needed and they fit perfectly! I can definitely feel the memory foam in these and hope they'll be comfy when I wear them out. So sad the cognac color sold out as I want those too!,4,10/24/2024,4.7
625,No Boundaries Women's Tall Western Boot,"I i wore these for six hours and while they're very comfortable, they started making a clicking sound on the heal, as cheap cowboy boots tend to do.

629,Airwalk Men's Aerial Low Sneakers,The overall sneakers were very nice and look great. My only issue was that they were about a half a size or mabe a whole size to tight.

Unfortunately they don't have much to keep them tight across the front of the foot, since the “laces” are just elastic that cannot be tightened. Since there's no way to secure them across the front/ankle portion of the shoe, they tend to slip off her heels quite a bit when she walks. She gets frustrated with them slipping so much %26 tends to not wear them as much as anticipated. They're cute, but not worth the expense in my opinion.",3,11/8/2024,4.7

652,Madden NYC Women's Lug Maryjane Shoes,Shoes are vintage and cute! My daughter loved them. My only complaint is comfort. The backs of the shoes had no  cushioning %26 were very stiff/hard so my daughter got blisters on the backs of both her feet after only wearing for an hour. Hopefully once they are worn in this will go away.,3,11/10/2024,4.3
653,Madden NYC Women's Lug Maryjane Shoes,I read the reviews for these that said they were narrow so I had to size up a whole size up because I have wide feet.

701,"Time and Tru Women's Scrunch Ballet Flats, Sizes 6-11, Wide Width Available","For reference, I'm a 5'4” 108 lb woman with long toes, narrow feet, small ankles, 

Technically, my feet are a “true” size 8. 
Frequently, however, the narrow width requires I purchase a size 7.5, as a compromise between length %26 width.

[It's hard to go about your business if a shoe flys off every few steps :) ]

Still, this isn't enough; any sort of sandal, dress shoe %26 especially flats—ballet flats in particular—are pointless purchases unless they have an adjustable ankle strap to keep them on my feet.

Furthermore, because my toes are long, they often are inadequately covered by the toe caps of flats, which looks awkward.

Thus, I ordered these (Size 8, medium width, NO adjustable ankle strap) ballet flats via Walmart home delivery with less than zero expectations %26 many self-recriminations over the wasting a Walmart associate/delivery driver's time %26 energy, as well as my own. But when you are panic-packing to catch a plane %26 only have a pair of flip flops with you, desperation shopping happens.

I thought perhaps I could stick tissues or something in the flats %26 hopefully find “real” shoes upon reaching my destinatio
But unbelievably, THESE BALLET FLATS FIT! And looked great! Perfectly appropriate, unnoticeable (in the right way) black flats in a professional, health-care related office setting.

They conform to the narrow width of my feet, cover my long toes, do not crowd my toes, stay attached to my feet, and did not cause ANY irritation, blisters, bleeding to the backs of my heels. I didn't even know this was possible; I thought heel blisters were unavoidable with any new shoes. Certainly, all of my designer shoes have caused them.

Obviously, these ballet flats are not investment footwear %26 are not shoes that can withstand daily wear %26 certainly not rough use or weather elements. Additionally, the soles are thin %26 not suitable for any sort of extended outdoor wear, and certainly not any type of gravel/cobblestone etc., surfaces. I would not choose them for a walking tour of a city or town. :)

Overall, in my personal experience with these ballet flats (which I know isn't applicable to most people, but I hope this review is helpful to someone out there), they fit as a true size 8, do not gape at the sides or slip off despite my narrow foot width, caused zero heel irritation, are comfortable, lightweight, pack EXTREMELY easily, are a great choice at an amazing price for (mostly) indoor price wear, or as backup shoes for high heels %26 I personally have had an amazing experience with them. 
Also, because the prevalent “incentivized” type reviews here %26 on most sites, often give me pause, please know I am a regular woman with zero incentive to write this, except to hopefully be helpful to other shoppers. I selected and paid for these shoes myself, have no connection to anything.  What even IS “Influenster” anyway? Lol

It's not worth it. Spend a little more and get a better quality item. I bought a different pair of these shoes by the same manufacturer for $17.98. The difference is HUGE!

Only wish is that they lasted longer - after walking an average of 10k steps/day, they last about 8 months before the inside bottom starts wearing down and becoming uncomfortable. Still, because of the price and comfort I think these shoes are worth it!
Usually a 7/7.5 in sneakers, and a 7 in this fits me well, especially since they are wide.",5,11/9/2024,4.2

756,"No Boundaries Women's Platform Casual Lace Up Sneakers, Wide Width Available",The shoes are cute and the price seems reasonable but even though I ordered the Wide version it is still too narrow for my foot with a large bunion and it hurts plus the heel area feels too big and slips around even with added heel cushions.

Not too heavy as other platforms they've worn but this is their first pair of low top platform sneakers.  Black and white to match most outfits. Looks of decent quality. Laces seem average to slightly above average. Not too much slip but not too much grip either on the soles.  Would be good for beginner skate boarding if that's what you are thinking about doing.  So far so good.,4,8/22/2024,4.7

788,"Avia Women's Comfort 2 Athletic Shoes, Sizes 6-11","Very comfortable shoes! Great price for the quality. Fits true to size, got them in black and received compliments the first time I wore them. Another customer had referenced these as comparable to the Hoka shoes, I've never tried Hoka shoes, and don't feel the need to after having these very comfortable shoes!",5,1/5/2025,4.6
789,"Avia Women's Comfort 2 Athletic Shoes, Sizes 6-11","I did the research and discovered these are supposed to be like Hoka dupes but way cheaper. I have had 2 back surgeries 8 years ago and have some lingering issues. I recently found a new job that requires both standing, walking and sitting but it's in a concrete warehouse. These came a day late but they came in time for my shift on Thursday, which was a miracle! The previous 3 days I had done around 2-4 miles per day and I was feeling it with my old shoes, even with some new shoes I was hobbling when I came home. I got these on and had to run out the door to work. I will warn you that if you are not used to thicker soles while driving, it takes a little bit of getting used to it with these shoes. I'm 6ft tall too so it didn't leave a lot of room in my corolla while driving. As far as the shoes though, I went through a 10 hr shift on a concrete floor having done around 5 miles and I was not dying in pain. I'm also not skinny and they are very supportive. I have wide balls of my feet and narrow heels and ankles and they were a bit tight at first but within an hour of wearing them they had adjusted to my feet and no longer felt tight. They also did not cause any blisters or sore spots, I was worried just throwing them on and heading to work I could expect some level of discomfort like most new shoes. They also have really good grip to floor even in the freezer or fridge area of the warehouse. They also seemed to keep my feet warm in a cool area. They will also add a few inches to your height, so I was like 6'2 with them on. 

I wish they made a high top version for more ankle support, but I am definitely happy with my purchase, if they last at least 6 months for the price I paid it's worth it!",5,11/17/2024,4.6

The only thing I didn't like was the box they arrived in.  I bought another pair for my daughter as a gift and this isn't exactly a gift giving box but for the price I will buy a nice gift bag. 

At $23 I am buying another pair for work.",5,11/20/2024,4.6

If you're looking for a cute and practical sneaker, these are a must-have!",5,1/15/2025,4.809523809523809
814,Avia 5000 Little & Big Kid Bungee Lace Chunky Trainer Sneakers,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 8 year old really likes these shoes. They are cute with the pink accent. She says they are super comfortable. They have a good arch support. They also came with stretch laces which are awesome. My daughter can tie her shoes but she loves the idea of quick slip on sneakers.,4,1/8/2025,4.809523809523809
815,Avia 5000 Little & Big Kid Bungee Lace Chunky Trainer Sneakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's somewhat heavier than I expected for a kid's shoe, but that only means it's heavy duty. My son has gone through 2 sneakers this year and I know it's because the quality isn't as good. This shoe should last a good while. He found it quite comfortable to wear as well. He hasn't quite gotten the grasp of tying his shoes yet, so I'm glad he still isn't forced to do so yet. I have a feeling this will last the rest of the school year at least.",4,1/21/2025,4.809523809523809
816,Avia 5000 Little & Big Kid Bungee Lace Chunky Trainer Sneakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] [Incentivized] I do not love these Avia sneackers. Sadly, they are too stiff and hurt my feet so they don't offer great support when walking. I usually wear a size 6.5 and received a 6 and they still fit big, so they do run large. My feet are pretty slim but even with a thicker sock they slip off as I walk. The color on the inside is not white it's a weird kind of peachy/pink and it seems as if they are dirty or stained. I do appreciate that there are no shoe laces to tie and they do seem to be sturdy to last many years but other than that I can't say I would recommend.",2,1/2/2025,4.809523809523809
817,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,Love! Wish they came in even more colors. Super comfortable for all day wear at work usually dress shoes and loafers start hurting my feet near the end of the day... But not these!,5,11/9/2024,4.4
818,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"I was so happily surprised with these shoes!  They are true to size, comfortable, and so stylish.  They do not look like discount store shoes.  I walked all around a museum the first day I wore them.  No blisters, no issues, just cute comfort!!",5,10/12/2024,4.4
819,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,I have been looking for a pair of loafers with a short heel. I saw that they were on sale and instantly got a pair. I ordered them online and they got to me in 3 days. They are so comfortable and I can wear socks with them and my foot doesn't feel tight at all. I definitely plan to get them in the other available color really soon.,5,12/18/2024,4.4
820,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"They fit very good.i just look cheap. So I was in the process of returning them. So I order two more pair from Amazon,real leather and more styless. when I receive them, yes they are cute but didn't fit well more expensive...so I decided to keep my time and true loafer.",5,1/1/2025,4.4
821,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"These are gorgeous!  Such a beautiful burgundy velvet! This loafer looks so much more expensive than it is (and on sale, it's a steal)!  I wear a 9 and sized down to an 8.5 after reading other reviews, and these shoes fit perfectly.  I didn't think I'd like them as much as I do... they definitely elevate an outfit!",5,11/8/2024,4.4
822,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"I love these shoes. I had to order, return and reorder to het the sizing right (which is understandable online vs in person shopping). However, the fir pair I received was pristine and had finished seams. The second pair had a raw edge where a smooth, finished seam should be. I wasn't so noticeable that I returned again, but it does call quality control into question.",4,10/13/2024,4.4
823,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"I wasn't sure what to expect from these loafers. They look cheap since they have such a shiny surface. The ankle part rubs on my foot, they come up to high. Would give me terrible blisters.",3,10/7/2024,4.4
824,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"If the sizing of these 9.5's is consistent across sizes, go up a half-size. I wear 10 in sneakers and 9.5 pretty consistently in dress shoes (a size 10 would likely fit me better). Also, I have narrow feet, and these feel very snug across the top of the foot, as well.",3,12/23/2024,4.4
825,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"Overall, I'm not displeased with these shoes. I won't be wearing them that often. I had hoped to be able to put pennies in the Penny slot, but it is not real. The shoe has a definite “plastic feel”. Also, after wearing twice, some of the stitching has already started coming loose you get what you pay for. These are not that expensive And look good with jeans or slacks.",3,11/23/2024,4.4
826,Time and Tru Women's Penny Loafers,"both shoes squeak with every step and the inner base of one shoe broke and clicks with every step. everyone at work has made a comment that they hear me coming. the squeaking started immediately and the clicking very soon after. i LOVE these shoes for the style, comfort and color but the literal noise is embarrassing. would buy in another color if they carried burgundy or a deep red.",2,12/3/2024,4.4
827,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,"These are a great shoe. We ended up returning the 9 and keeping a size 8 in these. My daughter is generally a 9, but the 9 was a bit loose, and she preferred the snugger fit of the 8. These were cheap enough to allow her to be comfortable in the 8 for as long as they fit.",5,9/9/2024,4.9
828,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,"I bought these for my 3.5 year old daughter, %26 she loves them! My daughters can be rough on their shoes, as most kids are, %26 it's nice to find shoes that don't break the bank if they do end up wearing out fast. These are definitely worth the price!",5,1/14/2025,4.9
829,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,Great quality honestly didn't expect it to be so good from Walmart but they have surpassed my expectations. Theyre so cute as well and my toddler is getting so many compliments at school for them from teachers and other kiddos. I will never spend more on name brand shoes for her and only get ones like this from Walmart. Honestly they are great!,5,9/9/2024,4.9
830,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,Love them. The yellow is a little different than in pictures but I still really like them. Only other thing is the **** of the shoe is a little short so that's why I rated 4/5 stars on quality.,5,1/31/2025,4.9
831,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,"Cute toddler shoes! Great dupes of Adidas Spezial handball gum sole shoes. I think it's adorable they can match with mommy. Comfort, quality and style exceeded my expectations for this price point. Much better than any of Target shoes in similar prices. I am not comparing these to Nikes or New Balance because it just wouldn't be fair. But they are close enough so I don't feel bad if they get worn down in the playground etc.",5,8/15/2024,4.9
832,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,My 2 year old loves these shoes.  They seem super comfortable because she doesn't insist I hold her like she does when she's wearing shoes she thinks aren't comfy.  The shoes are absolutely adorable and go with any outfit.,5,9/10/2024,4.9
833,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,These shoes are cute and look like a brand name sneaker. I like the gum bottoms as they won't look immediately dirty after my son wears them once. I had to return and size up from a 9 to a 10 so they may run a little small.,5,9/10/2024,4.9
834,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,These are super cute! My son loves that he can put them on himself and was excited to wear them.  From what I can tell they are comfy and true to size.,5,9/10/2024,4.9
835,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,"They look great on our little guy, but the red on the Velcro straps has stained the white parts of the tongue during wear (and I'm sure he's gotten his feet wet), but otherwise solid shoes for a toddler at a great price!",4,2/1/2025,4.9
836,Wonder Nation Toddler Kids Sport Sneaker,"seems to be a good pair of shoes for the price, they run a bit large. he has only worn them to try on, hoping they are more durable than they feel. im keeping them for my boy to grow into",3,11/16/2024,4.9
837,Wonder Nation Little Girl & Big Girl Skate Sneakers,"Even nicer in person and the print is also better in person very vivid
And shoe is made extremely well! They resemble skateboarder style shoes specifically they replicate a pair of vans that can run up to and over 100$. These were under 10$ u can't even beat if if u just need some play shoes for cheap. Don't regret my buy at all and totally recommend. My daughter is in a size 2 but I got a 3 bc I noticed looking at the measuremnts a size 3 is only barley a quarter inch difference so I did go up one size bc kids grow so fast! Quick shipment as well",5,12/16/2024,4.6
838,Wonder Nation Little Girl & Big Girl Skate Sneakers,"Great alternative to Converse or Vans. I love that these shoes provide a wider toe box. Very comfortable. I am a women's size 5.5.

843,Wonder Nation Little Girl & Big Girl Skate Sneakers,They could be cheaper but I will take it cause that is all I wear. The other ones was 5.88 and you can't get them in the girl size 6. You can get them in other sizes but not the girls size 6. I really liked them. But I will keep buying these so I will have shoes to wear.,4,6/7/2024,4.6
844,Wonder Nation Little Girl & Big Girl Skate Sneakers,"good quality amd adorable. my daughter is a size 1 1/2, i like to go up a little. so i bought these in size 2. way too big. wish they came in half sizes so i could get her size 1 1/2 which would fit best since these run too big.",4,4/15/2024,4.6

847,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,Especially for growing kids I think Walmart does a great job of carrying a decent shoe at an affordable price. I purchased this item for a student in need which makes it even better.,5,5/9/2024,4.5
848,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,The sneakers I purchased for my 9 year old son were so reasonably priced I brought 4 pairs in one shot.

849,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,"Overall, the quality for the price i paid, on sale, was well worth it. They are decently made shoes, and my son says they are really comfortable.  So far they are holding up well, especially considering he only has these and one other pair of shoes that fit him right now for school and play.",5,9/4/2024,4.5
850,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,"Perfect sneakers for your kid to beat up or for casual everyday use. Nothing negative to report.

852,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,I brought these shoes for my 6 year old son. They are very comfortable and are value for money. They look great. I have ordered these in different colors too.,5,9/4/2024,4.5
853,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,"these are pretty good quality for the price. the insole is clearly a little bit cheaper or made differently than say a name brand shoe like a new balance, but still comfortable enough for my kid to run and play in. shoe strings are easy to tie and untie, nice quality on those, very flexible sole and mesh upper. nice shoes when you are on a budget. so glad they came in the biggest big kids sizes, theres always a gap when shopping for big boys shoes between size 5 and 8 and its so hard to find any sizes for a growing kid who is between typical kids shoes sizes and adult mens sizes so this was a winner for that alone, AND it being good enough quality for daily playtime wear.",4,11/22/2024,4.5
854,Athletic Works Little & Big Kids Mesh Athletic Sneakers,"I got these for my son because he needs to wear black shoes with his school uniform. Within 2 weeks the shoelace tips started fraying and within leas than a month the front of the shoes are showing wear and tear already. Disappointing to say the least because that means I'll have to buy new ones soon, which means more money spent.",3,11/23/2024,4.5

They seem well made and are very comfortable. Considering I usually have to try on several pair of sneakers before I can find a pair that are comfortable, ordering these online seemed doomed to failure. Not the case here they fit perfectly. As others have stated they run a tad larger but that worked out perfectly for me. I always purchase a regular or slightly wider width and these were only available in medium. Running slightly larger the medium width actually feels closer to a wide width and for me that is a good thing.

The first time I wore them, it was for 8  hours, mostly standing. There was no break-in period and they were pretty comfortable right out of the box. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the arch support wasn't top-notch, which you sort of expect for a shoe of this price. I will probably buy some arch supports to put in them if I'm going to be wearing them for a long period of time. Otherwise, will just lace up and head out.",4,9/27/2024,4.4

898,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","""The sneakers I ordered, the Avia Elevate, are incredibly cute and comfortable. As a matter of fact, my roommate walked in as I was about to check out. She fell in love and said """"please order a pair for me in black!"""" So it was back to the shopping cart lol to add on her sneakers. We are very pleased with our order!!""",5,1/7/2025,4.5
899,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12",These are comfortable right out of the box. I wear them for outdoor pickleball and the soles last about 6 months.. Then I wear them for my indoor aerobics workouts. They look good and are well made..The price is great too! I bought several pair on clearance for $10 each.,5,12/27/2024,4.5
900,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's getting up there in age, can't bend over to tie sneakers, and cheap sneakers were no longer an option for him, yet I was doubtful if he'd slike slip-on sneakers.  So, trusting the Skechers brand, I ordered a pair, again as a Christmas gift!  He loves them so much that he threw out 4 pairs of used sneakers he bought at Salvation Army throughout the years (which I'm happy about).  But I do have a tip.  He wears a wide width but Skechers can be notorious for ""not exactly right widths"".  And slip-ons can make width feel tighter.  If you wear regular width, go wide.  And if you wear wide with, go extra wide (if available in your number size).  I got him extra wide and he loves it.  He also loves how light and comfy they are.  Skechers are definitely worth the money as long as you can figure out the right size/width combo.",5,12/28/2024,4.5
901,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","I have been buying this type of tennis shoe for a long time. I bought them in probably almost every single color. Earlier this year, my husband encouraged me to go to a different store to find a parachute that may last longer because with all of the walking I do, I wear out the soul. I ended up buying a more expensive pair of shoes, and they never fit my feet well. In fact, my feet were hurting after walking 1 mile after they had been broken in. So, I went back to my Walmart shoes and actually bought two different colors of these shoes.

There is something about these shoes that just fits my feet so well, they are super comfortable on the soles of my feet, and after building up the arches for my falling arches, they just fit so well with all of the walking I do",4,7/4/2024,4.5
902,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","I like these shoes a lot and I am very hard to fit. I wish the manufacturer didn't put a huge glop of adhesive under the insert though. I wear Orthotics and I always have to remove the factory insert and put my own in. The glue unfortunately tore my orthotic (which are hyper expensive). I found a solution- I'm just cutting a piece of paper towel to protect my orthotics in the future.

The color, size and comfort of the shoe are so far- so good. I have crappy feet and I always have to sacrifice pretty colors for comfort- but not in this case. I had tried the 9 wide- but my toes were too crunched in. The 9 1/2 W are perfect for me.

I used to spend big money for expensive shoes- now I don't have to- the same comfort is here- in AVIA!",4,2/27/2024,4.5
903,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","Had to order a size and a half bigger than size normally worn. All white needed for school uniform. Hoping these hold up for remainder of school year unlike the Skechers bought that didn't even last 6 mos. 
If they last will definitely be worth the $20 paid.",4,1/26/2025,4.5
904,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","Be warned, fellow Wal-Mart shoppers: These Avia sneakers are ""bricks"" -- w/less cushioning than the Athletic Works brand. Mind you, I'm a bit flat-footed, w/lymphedema issues on top of it, so the more cushioning I have (w/out paying through the nose for orthotics), the better. But the Avias? That's a nope from me. :-P Not much comfort for the $ I paid, so this is not a shoe brand I'd recommend.",3,12/27/2024,4.5
905,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12","I ordered these shoes because they are the same brand and style of the ones I was replacing. Usually I have good luck with that.   Unfortunately they are not even close in comfort.  They are stiff and hard.  The flat inner sole is like walking on a board.  I kept them for a few days to see if they softened up, but no luck and can't return them now.  I definitely do not recommend them.",2,1/30/2025,4.5
906,"Avia Women's Elevate Athletic Sneakers, Wide Width Available, Sizes 6-12",These shoes deserve zero stars. I thought I scored a deal when I saw them on sale for $9.99 but I was wrong. They're my size but uncomfortable especially around the back of the ankle. I used them once for a quick errand and felt the moment the shoes damaged the skin on the back of my ankles. I couldn't wait to get home and take the shoes off. I would not recommend these shoes.,1,11/23/2024,4.5
907,"No Boundaries Casual High Top Sneakers, Sizes 6-12, Women's","These are incredibly worth the very low price. they seem like they are of sturdy material and will hold up over time also easy to clean, and I get lots of compliments when I wear these people always stop and ask me if they are Converse or if they are good for lifting shoes in the gym my point is no one is looking at them thinking anything but positive thoughts !",5,11/30/2024,4.5
