30,"Xbox Series S, 512GB SSD, All Digital Gaming Console, Robot White","I've Been An X-Box Gamer For Over 15 Years. I Purchased My Last X-BOX ONE Second Hand From WalMart  Over 5 Years Ago and It Just Kinked Out. This Time I Wanted To Upgrade and I Purchased The XBOX Series S, Not 2nd Hand But Brand New. What Can I Say About It? 'I Love It' and I Am Pleasantly Surprised at How Small It Is Compared To The XBOX ONE, Wow, The Casing Shrunk A lot. Takes Up Alot Less Room On My TV Stand.  Set Up Was A Breeze and Connection To My Internet Service Was as Quick As Me Typing In My Internet Password.  I Must Admit I Was A Bit Leary About Purchasing The X-BOX Series S In The Color White, Because All Of My Gaming Consoles Have Always Been Black. I Was Very Nervous About How It Would Look On My Black TV Stand. Surprisingly It Really Looks Good and It Is Aesthetically Pleasing To Me. I Don't Write Reviews Too Often, But I Had To Write A Review On My Purchase of The XBOX Series S Because Its' An Upgrade From My XBOX ONE. I Also Still Have My XVOX 360 Which I Also Purchased From WalMart Many Years Ago And It Still Works Like Its' Brand New.  Purchase Most Of My Electronic Gadgets From WalMart Because Whether I Purchase It Brand New or Used I Am NEVER Disappointed Because I Am On A Tight Budget The Prices Are Always Within My Price Range.

He absolutely LOVES it...though I now fear I may never get time alone with my husband again. lol. j/k. It's a great system. The S series is completely digital which has its pros and cons. The pros are everything can be bought through the Xbox store so we don't have to worry about having a collection of boxes for games.

162,Restored Microsoft Xbox Series X Console with 1TB SSD (RRT-00001) - Black (Refurbished),"This would be a 5 star review aside from the simple fact that this Xbox came with a cockroach. I've lived in this house for 5 years now and never seen a cockroach till this package came into my living room . Fortunately I was able to catch this cockroach‚Ä¶.hopefully it's only one. This is really more of a burden than anything. I honestly wish I didn't get the Xbox because of this hitchhiker. Be careful when receiving a package from them. 

Aside from the Xbox, this console has amazing clean graphics. The console runs smoothly, meaning it's quiet. You don't even notice it's on! I don't have the best internet but it allows a smooth online play experience. Even with the size of it, due to the shape it is quite convenient to put on a shelf without it being too bulky. If your one to put down a controller and forgetting to turn it off, the controller will turn itself off automatically. Which will help you avoid to changing the batteries too often. Keep in mind this doesn't come with double AA rechargeable batteries; you will have to buy that separately. Also, you will need to buy a USB C cord to plug into the Xbox if you don't have batteries. Overall aside from the cockroach I love this thing. Hopefully soon I will be able to enjoy it without worrying about a creepy crawling bug being near me‚Ä¶",1,9/4/2024,3.8

I am very happy with this purchase, and it came very fast! My only complaint is actually through FedEx and not through Walmart. It was one of those purchases where a delivery is required to sign, so I needed to make sure that someone was home. that's not always an option for me, so I was scared that I would miss delivery and have to make arrangements to pick it up.

201,Xbox Series S + Xbox Wireless Controller Robot White + 3 Month Game Pass,"okay to start off, i have no clue about xboxs and my sons are wanting a ps5 but i couldnt afford that right now so they were happy with an Xbox which is why i purchased it. like other ppl have mentioned it does require a signature so make sure you are home that day itll be delivered. they do let you know what day and when its in transit from local post office so i got mine around 4pm. it got delivered quicker than original time which was nice. like a few days earlier.i had read that a lot of people said they didnt get their extra controller. i opened mine to make sure i got mine and i couldnt find but one in the box by itself. so long story short i reached out to antonline told them i was missing it but turns out it was in there. i just panicked and didn't look good enough but under the brown cardboard in the box with the actual gaming system you will find the extra controller and cords. i think people didnt realize because it is hidden almost. they were very quick to respond. i did email and call twice before i got to speak to someone and he told me to look again and there it was. they were quick and friendly. so that was relief. if you are missing one walmart will do a refund once you return to store or however you want to return it. thank goodness i didnt have any issues. i turned it on and set it up to make sure it works before i wrap it up for Christmas and so far it seems great. i will update if any issues after Christmas but seems like a good deal and customer service seems to quick at responding by email and phone. i still am unsure on how to redeem the free gaming pass because i didnt see any card in the box so i think its automatically on the account once you create one. so all in all this seems like its worth the buy. just take your time at looking for the other remote because it should be in there under the brown cardboard that looks like its part of the box.",5,12/14/2023,4.5

Order was missing a charging cable for the controller and the controller's left joystick doesn't work properly. It doesn't recognize the up motion. I was going to return it and get a new one but it was a gift for my sister and she said it was fine because the process to return it and get a new one was took much of a hassle since she would have to return the xbox as well.

Also this sadly only has game add ons which is nice but speaking from a view of having it a few weeks now, game pass is $100 worth the extra money.  if you are confused on which ""bundle"" to get please get the one with game pass or you will have to get it by itself for around $17 and still pay a high price for the system. also you can use this to go online as a pc which can be a very afforble option compared to a full on pc set up.",4,1/3/2024,4.7

286,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,"I purchased an Xbox Series X Diablo Edition through a vendor on WalMart.com. The vendor took the payment and sent the Xbox to another address that was not listed on my original order. I did confirm with Walmart customer service via chat and phone that they all had my correct address on the order. I also talked to a representative at USPS and he confirmed for me that the address the vendor put in the USPS system is different from mine. The Postal Service is currently investigating the issue as mail fraud and trying to repossess the package but they have not been able to, another reason they think it was fraud. I received an email from a dept at Walmart telling me they cannot refund me or replace the product after two of their reps said that a refund was definitely in order because of my issue. But the email directed me to dispute the charge on my card because currently you will not refund or replace the Xbox. I don't think an email with no appeal information is sufficient for this issue. I spent over $500 on an item from a vendor on your site and the only reason I trusted the transaction was because it was through Walmart.com and would never have thought your company would endorse vendors that would steal your customers money and their product. My information was entered correctly in your system and your vendor made the mistake. They have not contacted even though walmart reps say they contacted the vendor to get with me. Also, if necessary I am able to get the proof from the Postal Service showing the address that the package was actually delivered to because it was not delivered to my house like walmart tracking update claims. I will not be using Walmart.Com for anything from now on because they clearly don't make sure the vendors aren't scammers, they don't care about a customer losing over $500 when the customer did what they were supposed to do correctly and the issue is an internal walmart one. It's disappointing and disgusting that such a large company can't make things right especially when this is such a large purchase for most families right now and losing over $500 takes away my ability to give my child gifts on Christmas because I saved up and put it all into this purchase.",5,9/30/2024,4.7
287,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,"This package came very fast. I bought this for my brother for his birthday.

289,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,"It worked right out of the box, of course having an Xbox account helps. Diablo IV isn't a code, it's activated on an account when you add it, I'm not sure if it's the first one or not. Either way, system does what a current hen game system does, and it was a good deal when I bought it.",5,4/14/2024,4.7
290,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,"I purchased this when it was onsale for 350!!! I didn't install Diablo as it's a huge game and I didn't want it to eat my storage! For new Xboxseriesx owners, yes it's well worth the upgrade, so much worth it we updated all 3 in our home to  the series X! I have had it for several months now with no issues at all with the console and a lil stick drift, but that's normal for xbox series controllers for some reason nowadays after getting a lot of play.

291,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,"The graphics are great on it. The speed is faster. You could play old games and games for a different Xbox series. You could place it standing or on its side overall great product. The only thing I didn't like was the warranty wouldn't go through with my order, and when I went to add it in the store, it wasn't allowed unless I returned it and re bought it, but it was already set up and would've been a hassle to restart from scratch the downloads and account transfers with something that shouldn't have been removed my the web page when I placed the order.",5,1/24/2024,4.7
292,Xbox Series X ‚Äì Diablo¬Æ IV Bundle,The workers at Walmart are horrible. They literally walk out the building carrying your 500$ item like it's grocery . Either way the Xbox worked great but the cover in box was all faded as if it was reused . The console runs great and Diablo bundle worked just fine. I got everything for cheap during Christmas of 2023 so I saved a ton but I'm giving 4 stars due to bad worker showing no type of care for the items being picked up. As for everything else timing and product was perfect !,4,4/4/2024,4.7

340,"Microsoft Xbox One X 1TB Console, Black, CYV-00001","The programming in this version is just as buggy as the last. The Microsoft Edge doesn't exactly work like it should or you would want it to. There are still several glitches with the playing a videos on Facebook, perhaps or other websites that have automatic video play. Some of the programming for your File Explorer and your Photo viewing are still hinky.
There is no privacy setting on the Microsoft Edge that would prevent popups from coming up on your screen, adding new tabs. This would prevent unwanted sites from coming onto your Tab screen.
This creates a security issue.
Sometimes when I press my start button on my controller it doesn't start. And I sit two and a half feet away from the box and it refuses to start up when I press the button.
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good things about this. It produces high resolution video. It has the 4K video and a 1 terabyte drive. Some of the loading is faster, except for a few video games that I happen to play. I'm going to assume that it's the game itself that refuses to load that the game is glitching not the Xbox.

They attach a letter stating how they clean each console and let me tell you as an IT worker and avid collector of games this thing was not touched to clean EVER! IN FACT IT HAD ROACHES FALLING OUT OF IT!
