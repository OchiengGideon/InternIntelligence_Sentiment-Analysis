0,"Restored Playstation 2 Slim Console PS2 System, Reshelled (Refurbished)",,5,2/9/2025,5.0
1,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,Actually i dont know anything about gaming. I bought this for my son for his birthday. I looked on target and then Walmart and Walmart had it before target the one near me so I decided to order it. It was actually really nice cause it was ready like I said less than an hour.,5,8/19/2024,4.7
2,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,Price is still very high. I think Walmart should do better deals when it comes to game consoles. The PlayStation 5 is a multi million sold product with other products in the store I think it would be okay to lose some profit to make more profit.,5,9/19/2024,4.7
3,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,affordable price and quality of product was better than expected. overall was a great experience and glad there were no complications with my order or at checkout.,5,8/4/2024,4.7
4,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,"This review is short because I am not reviewing the PlayStation itself. It works exactly as advertised and shown through various videos online. As for buying through this Walmart seller, I got exactly what I ordered and the box was discreet. The PS5 box was sealed and nothing inside indicated it had been opened before. Started with no trouble. I'm writing this a few days after setting it up and have no complaints. Shipping was suuuper quick! Only complaint is Sony not making this coming in multiple colors!",5,1/4/2024,4.7
5,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,"I love this ps5, I added the disc player to it because I had a bunch of ps4 games and movies so adding the disc player was very easy to do, cost 70 extra to add it. Only thing I would say is I would get more memory space since this only came with 800 something GB. But I can add more memory internally of needed but it will cost about 300 for 4 TB's",5,2/28/2024,4.7
6,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,Now this goes for all consoles when you switch. Unless you had a PlayStation Account in the past WITH games your gonna have no games. So when you buy this make sure to get a game. Besides that good console. Compared to the OG PS5 it's way smaller but runs the same. Way more compact and good for a small desk.,5,12/24/2023,4.7
7,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,Had one in the past. Price was one the same as any other site where I could find it . It was convenient to order from Walmart,5,9/8/2024,4.7
8,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,My package was suppose to come between 11am-3pm saturday and i never received but a representative told me that the driver said they asked the “customer” to verify their information and gave it to a young female. Me %26 my grandmother are the only ones that live in her home and neither of us received this package and in the picture i dont see a face or nothing even the clothes the individual is wearing is not mines %26 there hands are bigger than mines and they are darker than me. Walmart is very unprofessional and told me there is nothing they can do about it but i will sue you guys if im not accommodated i spend my money online shopping all the time and never have any issues i received all of my orders but this one no one in the neighborhood knows my information to verify anything and my grandma didnt know i ordered this package the least you guys can do is reship the item ATLEAST. How is it my fault i paid almost $500 for an order and you guys tell me there is nothing you can do but then when you get a lawsuit coming its a problem but next time tell your drivers to verify the information before handing a stranger my order %26 tell the truth and give me a description of who you guys gave the order to. Also showing photos because my hands are smaller than whoever this is and i have long small braids in my head with pink almond shaped nails.,1,1/17/2024,4.7
9,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,"When i received the playstation and took it out of the box the safety seal was broken, the top was open and it was damaged on the sides of the box. I'm hoping this item wasn't returned and works properly because I intend to give it as a gift. Walmart needs to make sure online shoppers aren't being shipped open items because we do have options to return the item and prefer not to have to be bothered with the hassle of standing in a long line to return something that should be sealed and unopened. Its an inconvenience and it defeats the purpose of online shopping. Something that cost almost 500 dollars should be sealed and new. I'm hoping this works because 
I don't want my child to be disappointed on Christmas Day. This seems to be an issue another shopper had as well. This will be my last large purchase from Walmart due to this disrespectful move on their behalf. Items shipped to customers need to be new unopened and sealed, not damaged on the box and opened. This was not damaged during transit. It was placed in the box like this.  I didn't pay for an open box item and should not have received it in that condition.",1,12/20/2023,4.7
10,PlayStation 5 Digital Console Slim,Issues getting delivers issues using app issues with contacting anyone issues were made in your end that caused delivery to be denied. Nothing was right.,1,10/19/2024,4.7
11,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"yes you can use your phone for remote play but it just feels clunky and odd.  using the portal feels like using a ps5. the lag is Noticable on occasion.  i wouldn't use it to play COD or TEKKEN but i would use it for god of war and 1 player games similar to that.  it's it still worth 199?!? 150 would be the sweet spot,  but it's Sony being Sony.",5,12/13/2023,4.4
12,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,Been really hard to fix a bundle with both controllers. It was a sigh of relief to see that Walmart had all I needed. It was so good I brought the ps5 portable too!!!!!,5,9/17/2024,4.4
13,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"Was able to get this through the HotStocks App just in time for Valentine's Day. Only concern is they didn't put any padding between the shipment box and the box for the portal itself and there was a considerable amount of room between them. And the Portal itself wasn't padded either, which is odd considering how much I paid for shipping.",5,2/12/2024,4.4
14,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"Overall it is handy but not perfect. The joysticks make ticking/clicking sounds in a certain direction, something is hitting inside. Adaptive triggers make super loud vibrating noise but can be weakened/disabled in the settings.
Also even though I have a hardwired PS5 and have a high-end router nearby in a congestion-free channel, there is a minimal stutter in fast-moving scenes. Remote play on PC and other devices is always smooth, PS Portal is not when it should be.
All issues mentioned above are very common if you search online.
I will be returning mine and then wait for SONY to fix these issues. My suggestion - ignore PS fanboys blindly buying this thing. Study your network settings and research the fixes for the issues mentioned before purchasing it.",2,12/5/2023,4.4
15,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,Don’t trust Walmart anymore my order never arrive and they haven’t don’t nothing to help me really disappointed about Walmart they really don’t support their customers or issues with orders I won’t buy my stuff from Walmart anymore is a waste of time and money,1,3/3/2024,4.4
16,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"I ordered this and recieved wrong item i chatted with an agent and was told ""KEEP WRONG ITEM REFUND WILL BE PROCESSED NOW"" i was lied to and now i jave to wait 14 business day because of walmarts errors. I asked to return wrong item instore and was denied that too. I asked for a $20 gift card for this SERIOUS INCONVIENCE AND WAS IGNORED!!!!! SO MUCH FOR MY CHILDS CHRISTMAS PRESENT THANKS WALMART FOR CRAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE",1,12/4/2023,4.4
17,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"You would think it will connect to a WiFi, no matter if it’s strong, it’s constantly disconnecting and connecting. It’s so frustrating. PS5 needs to make the device to connect to any strength. Or otherwise, the portal is useless. I would have given no stars; it doesn’t deserves any to begin with.",1,1/30/2024,4.4
18,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,It is ridiculous that walmart is able to sell the playstation portal to a 3rd party and then buy it back to sell it at a markup. I'm pretty sure that is illegal. Will no longer be giving walmart my business.,1,1/12/2024,4.4
19,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"The item itself was fine. 

Here was the issue I had with the seller. I bought the play station portal for over a triple markup with 2 day shipping on Dec 19. (I knew what I was paying for, which was to have the item by Christmas. It was my child's Christmas gift. 

The seller waited 3 days to ship the item. 
It arrived 4 days after Christmas Dec 30.

Multiple attempts to contact the seller were unsuccessful.

They should not be listed as a pro seller on this site. 

Again,  no issues with the item, but I paid a HUGE premium markup to get it by Christmas. 

I should get that extra that I paid back, like I should only be charged retail price for the item but I doubly they will correct it %26 I'll have to eat the cost .",1,2/9/2024,4.4
20,PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5 Console,"thebestofthewest 3rd party seller AVOID!!
will not refund even though havent recieved item! 
also walmart will not refund cause they dont guarantee anything by third party on their marketplace.

if you can buy from anywhere even the gutter, go ahead and get it there you will have better luck with customer service",1,3/13/2024,4.4
21,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,I had a hard time finding the console with a disc version available and walmart had it for a decent price. It was also shipped nicely with no damage on the packaging.,5,11/27/2024,4.7
22,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"The sticker that came with the Fortnite bundle when you scratch it off you almost risk scratching the numbers off, and the previous comment I made was about a different order. This order was amazing. All the employees were amazing.",5,11/29/2024,4.7
23,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,Christmas gift I don't think my husband has a clue for a man that never asked for anything I heard him say he would like a new 1 so I'm excited to see his face Christmas morning,5,12/1/2024,4.7
24,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"AMAZING! I used to be an Xbox fan! And I was debating between both ps5 and the Xbox series x. I decided to go with the ps5, I was regretting my decision once I seen how much a new controller would be. But then I decided to give a chance I already bought it might as well try it out. I played the robot Ps5 game they have for you and it lets you use your new controller with every function possible. SOLD ME RIGHT THERE! I felt like a kid in a candy shop! THAT CONTROLLER WAS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR! The advanced technology they put into their controller ! WOW! I DONT REGRET IT ONE BIT I RECOMMEND IT 1000%",5,1/22/2025,4.7
25,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,I love the system. Only issue was the box my ps5 was shipped in. The shipping box was twice the size of my ps5 box. If there would have been some kind of packing material to keep my system from flopping around inside of a shipping box that would have been great. Please think about the security of the item. How would you like your things shipped to you?,5,12/2/2024,4.7
26,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"Never received item was very excited , the driver named jeffrey took a picture of a white wall with no numbers  saying it was delivered and i missed the deal. could not reorder walmart kept cancelling order. he most likely stole it. last time i order from walmart online .",1,12/3/2024,4.7
27,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"Terrible shipping!!! Thrown in a box with NO padding, etc and the seal on the ps5 box was broken!! We returned same day, not going to deal with this nonsense.",1,11/28/2024,4.7
28,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"Having a box arrive looking like it went through a wood chipper is very discouraging after buying this to replace the previous PS5 bought 4 days before Christmas from Walmart that quit working 15 min into Christmas Day. 
Not only is the Walmart box that it arrived in totally mangled but the box that holds the PS5 in it has a huge puncture through it, fortunately it seems whatever pierced through the box missed the console by a few centimeters. Hopefully this one will last longer than the last at a whopping 4 days of use.",1,1/15/2025,4.7
29,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"ZERO STARS…..FIRE HAZARD
After only a couple weeks of use the console made a popping sound and started smoking. The console was not in use but it was plugged in. I quickly unplugged it and moved it outside. 
What would have happened if I wasn't home??? House fire?? Scary thought!",1,1/14/2025,4.7
30,PlayStation 5 Disc Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,I got a region locked Ps5 that only recognizes the UK - I live in California - for some reason the store will not take it because it is a bundle -  when i call Walmart they keep sending me a return label for the store - dude this is the worst process ever,1,1/3/2025,4.7
31,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,Product exactly what I was looking for. Had been researching for a long time. Price was competitive and timely delivery made difference in deciding to purchase from Walmart,5,7/25/2024,4.7
32,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,"Well, honestly, I gotta say, from ordering the PS5 to having it shipped to the store so nothing would happen to it, I just hooked it up a couple of hours ago. I gotta say, PlayStation has come a long way. I am really digging the system, and to be honest, I just got the Xbox Series X in December. I can't really decide which is a better system, honestly, but as of now, I'm digging the voice feature on the controller very much. It is so nice; I don't have to buy a headset for the PlayStation. I can use the controller itself for communication. But not only that, I could go ahead and tell the PlayStation to shut down with the controller hands-free. I really love the operating system, and I feel it's a little bit more organized than the Xbox. As for the graphics, I don't know yet because I'm still downloading some games, so tomorrow, that's when I'll be able to really tell the difference. But regardless, I'm happy with the system and my experience with Walmart",5,2/15/2024,4.7
33,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,"I play games and I've been considering a deal for years now. I was happy with the price and so far, I'm highly impressed by the console's performance",5,10/12/2024,4.7
34,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,Playstation 5 consolé is gaming on another level. Experience a creative and fun environment with the new updates.,5,10/17/2024,4.7
35,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,"Box is undamaged and exactly what I expected. No real complaints about the price, it was comparable to most other places around.",5,10/4/2024,4.7
36,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,Thought it was going to be an impulse purchase I would regret but it's ridiculously better than my old PS4 and you can instantly notice the difference just buy it,5,1/24/2024,4.7
37,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,"My 3 star rating reflects my opinion more on our local Walmart than it actually does the PS5 system itself. I would give the system a 5 out of 5 stars, but our local Walmart gave me a box that was opened and someone attempted to reseal it. At first glance everything appeared there, and hooking the system up everything worked as it should. But afterward we found out the horizontal stands were missing, and after checking the box and packing 4 times there were no signs of them. Our local Walmart has really gone down hill in quality and this will be my last electronics purchase there.",3,2/12/2024,4.7
38,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,Damaged box so items inside had to be shaken and possibly broken. I never opened it just returned it due to the unknown,1,10/11/2024,4.7
39,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,I get home and pull it out the box just for it to be a used ps5 covered in some dried up liquid and scuff marks. Plugged it in and it won't even turn on! Thanks for wasting my time and money Walmart!!,1,1/16/2024,4.7
40,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim,"The product never arrived, do not order it, buy on the same Sony website, you will not have these problems, those who deliver things at Wallmart are not trustworthy, differents buildings",1,2/7/2024,4.7

42,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario","I was a bit hesitant to buy a control that was selling for so cheap, but so far so good. I do wish it had a longer battery life, but other than that its perfect for our gaming needs ty! not bad quality for the price!",5,12/29/2024,4.1
43,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario","very cute especially in person. i like how it vibrates while playing GTA, which means it lets me feel the little bumps on the game that you wouldn't normally feel with my regular ps4 controller",5,7/12/2024,4.1
44,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario","Nowhere to lie, this is the best bang for your buck. Identical in appearance to a Sony controller, yet a fraction lighter, it meets and even exceeds some standards set by the original. The triggers and buttons are tactile and responsive. The TouchPad is quiet and sensitive. It will pair to anything (mobile, PC, other consoles). The ONLY little niggle I hve with the product is that sometims you hve to try to sync it twice to the Playstation 4, but at a price point of about 35% of the cost of a Sony product, pressing one button twice to turn it on isn't the worst sacrifice. 9 on 10.",5,4/9/2024,4.1
45,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario",The controller came early which was exciting. The only problem I had was that there's some paint missing around the thumb stick area but it isn't noticeable unless you really look for it. Overall I am in love with this controller.,4,9/30/2024,4.1
46,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario",I bought this from Walmart and was really surprised. It has lasted me well over a year before the buttons started wearing down and getting stuck. I just bought a new one but will be holding on to this for a backup.,4,6/29/2024,4.1
47,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario",It's not the controller itself the buttons and the overall unsure unsureness behind choosing is hilarious I'm returning it to store this week for a different color,2,10/14/2024,4.1
48,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario","Not worth, do not buy. The controller is fully charged but is constantly disconnecting from the console. The aux port to connect your headphones to is also finicky, the audio is constantly going in and out and the wire needs to be moved a specific way for it to function properly. (Headphones work fine with ps5 controller)",1,9/28/2024,4.1
49,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario","It seemed pretty cool at first, but just less than 2 months after having it the R1 %26 R2 triggers stopped working. That's past the 1 month return window with Walmart, %26 it's my fault for not paying for the extended warranty. Just a heads up for anyone else wanting to buy this.",1,10/15/2024,4.1
50,"INFISU Wireless Controllerfor PS4 ,Rechargeable Playstation 4 Controller Remote Compatible with Playstation 4/Slim/Pro,6-Axis Sensor and Dual Vibration Game Pad, Best Game Lover Gift,Mario",Worked for a week that was it this controller is garbage and I had to keep controller plugged in to even use it I learned my lesson about buying cheap controllers just buy a official ps4 controller,1,10/1/2024,4.1
51,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,This product was super easy to unbox and plug up the price was a great deal i couldnt pass up never been happier with it the quality is great and spot on as described i give it a full on 10,5,11/29/2024,4.7
52,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,Walmart.com beat Amazon.com in product availability and price. And in delivery speed. Very impressed.  Thank you,5,11/24/2024,4.7
53,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,This item was a gift… I refused to spend over **** dollars on a gaming console and once the price came down on it I knew I had to buy it. The box was in good condition I do not know how everything works with it because it will not be opened until Christmas Day,5,12/9/2024,4.7
54,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,I bought the Ps5 on the black friday sale so I definitely can't complain about spending $**** instead of $****. Product came working perfectly with no damages to it or the box that it came in. Shipping was very quick as I received the product next day when we were expecting 3 day shipping.,5,12/6/2024,4.7
55,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,Why would you mail this in a box with 2 holes so people can see whats inside the box. It's a month before Christmas obviously it's a present.,3,11/24/2024,4.7
56,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,Only thing is the shipping it came in a huge box's only securing it was paper. I had order same game console from Best Buy and the packaging was excellent they secured it with paper and bubble wrap. I think Walmart could have put a little more effort on the packaging.,3,12/8/2024,4.7
57,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,The product was not inside of its original packaging when it was delivered to me. Someone stole the console and controller from the box but placed the box back inside the packaging box. I also noticed the bottom of the box that was Walmart package taped was cut open and clear tape was placed over it. So I'm not sure if it was a Walmart theft situation or a FedEx theft situation,1,11/27/2024,4.7
58,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,Never received item. Your associates either stole it or negligently let a random person pick up my $**** item!!!! I'm **** off and going to every social media platform to let everyone know what happened to me and this awful person experience!,1,12/4/2024,4.7
59,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,I never received my Playstation 5 instead I was sent t shirts and socks in a bag with my order number that was suppose to be  a Playstation and a disney book.

60,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle,"I ordered this same playstation twice over the course of two days and NEITHER of them worked. The first return was processed smoothly but now, the site is having a ""technical issue"" so I can't even get my return. I am UPSET that I've spent $400 twice in three days to receive TWO clearly broken PS5 systems. That literally makes no sense. My son is BEYOND disappointed and we are both so frustrated with this situation.",1,11/26/2024,4.7

62,Restored Sony PlayStation 4 Console w/ 500GB HDD & Accessories - CUH-1215A - Jet Black (Refurbished),"I bought for my granddaughters. The console arrived clean and spotless which did not look used as it was a gift. I had my son connect it to make sure everything worked and it set up perfectly.

65,Restored Sony PlayStation 4 Console w/ 500GB HDD & Accessories - CUH-1215A - Jet Black (Refurbished),"It turns on right away, there's no glitches, but it should be actually cleaned.

70,Restored Sony PlayStation 4 Console w/ 500GB HDD & Accessories - CUH-1215A - Jet Black (Refurbished),I wouldn't recommend this very much so. I was having issue with the game system staying on. I was also having issue with the controller staying connected to the game system. I paid 200 and something for the system. I had to spend extra money and buy a HDMI CORD and another controller. I didn't receive no type of money back or anything. PLEASE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS,1,10/30/2024,3.8

76,PlayStation 5 Digital Slim Edition Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle + Extra PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller Starlight Blue,"Items are not brand new PlayStation came with dirt marks and controller had a stick drift with worn out grips. Contacted seller about controller for replacement and directed me to Sony as “they are brand new” . 

Contacted Sony, Sony looked up controller with serial number and showed it was previously purchased in 2022 and his out of warranty. Emailed seller that's only denied replacement due to auto warranty and seller stopped responding via email. Contacted Walmart support about situation and all they could offer was a full refund in return for a full return. Did not want to go through the hassle of returning every item as it was just one singular item that was defective. 

Awful experience will never buy again! Nothing was “new“. B grade at best.",2,1/10/2025,4.6

Never received my package although there was a picture of it being delivered. I live in an unsecured building and now after using the money and speaking to Walmart twice and they said they'd help I have no money to replace, no replacement, and no refund. I am done with Walmart because a birthday gift which was gonna now become a Christmas gift resulted in nothing and no help. I am disappointed in the service I received and truly disgusted at this point. This is why I'm faithful to Amazon. I would add a picture but the picture is already there nothing!",1,12/18/2024,4.6
80,PlayStation 5 Digital Slim Edition Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle + Extra PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller Starlight Blue,This game console in my opinion is pointless.

81,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"This is a short review of the PS5 30th Anniversary edition, first console really looks like the old classic ps1 the color is great and looks way better than your normal ps5 this also included the vertical stand which is normally sold separate that's good from sony to include one, the  extras accessories like the controller plug housing really make it look like a ps1 controller and the poster included is huge all the extras is just acing of the cake really glad with this PS5 30th anniversary too bad the were extremely limited",5,11/22/2024,4.3
82,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,Walmart came through with this limited edition ps5 for me.  Hoping anyone who wanted one will be able to get one.  As for the ps5 basically it's a slim ps5 but with the limited edition design and controller.  I wish it came with a disc drive but you have to buy one separately if you want that.  Good news is this one comes with a cover so it matched the system if you choose to get the disc drive.,5,11/24/2024,4.3
83,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"THANK YOU WALMART!!!! 
This is such a great anniversary edition of playstation so far, it's really cool although no physical media version was released it does come with cover for disc adapter when you adapt it.

84,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"While the product I ordered arrived on time, I was very disappointed to find the package had arrived in an open box. It appeared to have been tampered with, as items inside were clearly moved around. I don't know the intentions behind this, but it's extremely concerning and disappointing. Walmart needs to do a much better job with their handling and packaging to ensure customers feel confident in the safety and integrity of their orders.",3,11/23/2024,4.3
85,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"I love the console, the problem was with the person who put it in the shipping box.  I received it with a slashed seal and someone took the corner of the box and tore it about four inches from the corner.  (this was supposed to be a new unit sold and shipped by Walmart).  Also the shipping box was not damaged or opened, so this tells me the damage was done prior to being placed in the shipping box and sealed.",2,11/27/2024,4.3
86,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"Got Walmart plus for the pre-order we did a month and a half for the pre-order to be delivered and I'm sure just like everyone else's account. It said it needed to be signed for. I made an account with FedEx. It also said it needed to be signed for, the delivery they completely disregard the note on my door to knock or ring the bell. They leave my package at my front door, which is 10 steps away from a busy street and where people are constantly walking and I come down an hour and a half later, my package is gone the so-called support team that Walmart has passed me around for 48 hours not giving me answers not giving me information telling me it's still gonna be delivered even though there was an image of it at my door. to finally be told that they'll just give you a refund because they're not gonna send you a replacement because it cost too much. They have more consuls that their warehouses won't send you one because it's a higher priced item, but they won't go through the steps like having someone sign for it to prevent things like that happening so I waited a month and a half for nothing for my package to get stolen and Walmart did absolutely nothing for me so watch what you buy from!",1,11/24/2024,4.3
87,PlayStation 5 Digital Edition - 30th Anniversary Limited Edition,"This review is about the experience of receiving this item from Walmart. When I opened up the shipping box, the PS5 30th Anniversary box seal was already sliced open. Now the top flap is opening up. I purchased this as a gift. It is disappointing and frustrating that the item already appears open.  It was difficult enough to be able to purchase the item and no way of replacing it for an unopened one.",1,11/21/2024,4.3

91,Sony PlayStation Classic - PlayStation,Product works great.,5,1/13/2025,3.375
92,Sony PlayStation Classic - PlayStation,"Bought for Xmas2024, have not opened yet. 7 yo wants a ps5 but I'm not ready for that. Bought this as a “starter” PlayStation gift. I'm gonna clear up some details.

You get a console about the size of a cell phone but a little thicker. Comes with two remotes, cords measured roughly 54 inches, which seem a little short. Connectors are usb ends, maybe extensions available but idk. Comes with hdmi cable to connect to tv. Comes with standard usb cable for power supple- the cube part which is the plug into the wall is NOT INCLUDED but that's pretty common these days so just make sure you have or get a charger cube. Box says “5V, 1.0A minimum” for power cube size. It's a standard power supply cube.

Games are decent, 6:10. Over all I think kiddo will enjoy and so will I. These are games I remember playing (I'm ~40 yo). Final fantasy 7, the original GTA, original twisted metal, metal gear solid, cool boarders 2, IQ, oddworld, tekken3, battle arena toshiden, res evil DC, rayman- those are the big names I recall. 20 in total. You cannot upgrade or add anything. Comes as is. 

Overall it's adorable and I think for the price, it will be well worth it and get many hours of entertainment from it!",4,12/7/2024,3.375

Spoke with seller and the solution is the same, return or have sony fix. mind you I also paid for insuramce but since it was only in my posession for less then an hour, I had to go through Sony first. ultimately be careful when purchasing from Wal-Mart because your options are limited.

151,Restored Sony PlayStation 4 Pro - Game console - 4K - HDR - 1 TB HDD - jet black (Refurbished),"Reading some of the other reviews made me nervous to order from this seller, but I am pleased to say everything went great! The box arrived somewhat bent in on one side despite being marked fragile, which I know is the post office's fault, so I was worried the contents would be damaged. Everything works great! Everything was individually wrapped in soft foam to protect it and the system itself had a few layers of bubble wrap. The PlayStation's condition is to be expected as a refurbished piece, but any outer dings are hardly noticeable when on my shelf. They even sent me a free game! Such acts out of an independent seller like this are so amazing and kind of them. If I ever need any other product that they have, they'll be the first I check!",5,11/27/2023,4.371428571428571

I’ve been using it for 2 whole days now %26 it’s perfect. Came to me sealed and everything was in the box including the game code. Everything was brand new not used. The console is so quiet as well..unlike my regular ps5 I have. The ps5 box was in good shape..the top corner had a small dent in it but it’s not a big deal. Only downside I could say is..the FedEx delivery guy didn’t ask me for a signature so be aware of that %26 make sure your home on delivery day just in case it’s raining or you got some thief’s in the neighborhood. Also it comes in a Walmart box so no one knows what’s inside which is a good thing! Overall I say if you’re planning on buying..order it!",5,12/29/2023,4.7

Definitely was worth the purchase for me though.",5,12/30/2023,4.7
213,PlayStation 5 Disc Console Slim - Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Bundle,"Skeptical at first because I thought it was going to get stolen, only because the reviews on the other ps5 bundle had a lot of 1 star reviews stating that their ps5 got stolen by the delivery guy and they couldn’t get a refund. This scared me at first because I didn’t want mine to also get stolen but so glad it didn’t. I highly suggest purchasing one in person, in a trusted store. If they don’t have the specific one your looking for, just wait patiently for one to arrive in the store. It’s better than risking it for an online order. Other than that, it came in earlier than planned which was great. Also came in early in the day. Works great and the game code worked as well. Very happy it didn’t get stolen, which shouldn’t be a problem in the first place. The slim version fits perfectly in my tv stand. Isn’t loud at all and runs great.",4,11/14/2023,4.7

I was already thinking this is sketchy. I went to look inside the ps 5 box and I noticed that the sticker to hold the box was ripped. It was definitely already opened or used. The cords had those bread twistie ties on them. Definitely disappointed but if I send it back now and order a new one it may not be here by Xmas. This is my son’s only gift and I can’t chance ruining his holiday. Hopefully it works.,1,11/30/2023,4.7

220,Sony PlayStation 5 Console Disc (Slim) with EA Sports Madden NFL 25 - PlayStation 5,"kids love it, but not kid friendly to operate or get online to play. Takes forever to download a game to play. and once you download a couple games one terabyte of your memory is gone, which is all your memory you have on the console. Then you got to go spend $250 to get a couple more terabytes of storage to add a few more games. now I know why there are only a handful of games for it. Sony could have done a lot better upgrades the PS4 to the PS5 honestly it's no different than the PS4 other than just cost a lot more for the console and accessories. The graphics are equal to each other.

Now to only realize after the first play of a game I already bought previous to this system …, the system files are still corrupt.  As I let it restart itself, it continues to be corrupt.

303,Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller,"Overall, the controller works very well. I'm not a professional gamer, but apparently I'm hard on my controllers.  I've gone through 4 controllers.  One of the controllers was sent back under warranty.  I purchased this controller so I could swap out the stick modules when they invariably develop stick drift.  I wasn't interested in the programmable profiles. 
I didn't do enough research on the stick modules because it looks as if the bots have won again because you cannot purchase a replacement stick module at MSRP anywhere.  The scalpers are charging nearly as much for a replacement module as a new Dual Sense controller.  It's a big scam.",3,1/16/2025,4.6
304,Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller,"My kids and I recently went through a devastating house fire, a complete loss. I ordered this $200  controller, and the way arrived is disgraceful!

305,Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller,"I ordered this Sony Dualsense Edge online to be shipped, but they instead delivered from the store a unit slashed almost entirely open on the lid and slashed on the box front out of a stock of 5 or 6 at the store, per the website. They won't allow a shipped or picked up return for this item because of fraud potential as policy. I am disabled from a stroke and can't drive/can't return in person. I was told on 12/29 by level 2 customer service I would be emailed a return label in 48hrs. 72hrs later on 1/1 another level 2 agent said 48hrs. That was 8 days ago and hours of my time wasted on hold with customer service. I've now had to get agency/manager approval for my in-home personal care assistant to drive the 17 miles to return this in person. This is how a disabled Walmart  customer that relies on home delivery is treated - like a con artist.  Never treat yourself to something nice from these people as a Walmart   customer. They will deliver to you what they won't look you in the eye and sell you in person. Hopefully my PCA won't have to stand in the returns line at the store too long and will get back in time for me to bathe before the weekend. Disgusting.",1,1/10/2025,4.6

I paid 200 dollars for this controller just to be lied to by your company like I did something wrong I was told that because it's not the correct controller they can't accept it back even though it was sold to me by your company this is very unprofessional all I'm looking for is a replacement because I didn't make the mistake the workers did.,1,2/1/2025,4.6

Ultimate Team is my favorite game mode and it's been pretty fun. There are still certainly some classic EA Sports flaws in the gameplay. One example is the new boom tech powered by Fieldsense. This year the hitstick is a lot different because you have to time it almost perfectly or else the hit is going to be weaker. Sometimes it just glitches out and the ball carrier will break a ton of tackles if you don't time the hit right.

The game select screen is a mess. Not many options unless you can find a USB keyboard that can access all the hidden options like changing all the games back to NTSC.

The outer PS5 box was ripped, the clear big round seal (which tells you if it's unopened) was missing completely, the God of War game voucher was completely missing. There were gross finger prints all over the PS5 unit everywhere with wipe marks on power button, unit, etc, and powercords, stand and things were missing protective coverings, twist ties gone and many of the things that you would expect there from a new and expensive unit. I was disgusted when I looked inside of the Walmart box it came in. I wrapped it back up (better than it was when I opened it, mind you) with it's original gross finger prints on it, packaged it back up, and back it goes for a full refund.

We checked out every connection and did trouble shooting and still nothing, came back 8 hours later and still will not turn on.

Apparently this is a known issue, YouTube is full of vidoes about this shutting off issue and more.

One of the controllers was sent back under warranty.  I purchased this controller so I could swap out the stick modules when they invariably develop stick drift.  I wasn't interested in the programmable profiles. 
I didn't do enough research on the stick modules because it looks as if the bots have won again because you cannot purchase a replacement stick module at MSRP anywhere.  The scalpers are charging nearly as much for a replacement module as a new Dual Sense controller.  It's a big scam.",3,1/16/2025,4.6

396,Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller,"I ordered this Sony Dualsense Edge online to be shipped, but they instead delivered from the store a unit slashed almost entirely open on the lid and slashed on the box front out of a stock of 5 or 6 at the store, per the website. They won't allow a shipped or picked up return for this item because of fraud potential as policy. I am disabled from a stroke and can't drive/can't return in person. I was told on 12/29 by level 2 customer service I would be emailed a return label in 48hrs. 72hrs later on 1/1 another level 2 agent said 48hrs. That was 8 days ago and hours of my time wasted on hold with customer service. I've now had to get agency/manager approval for my in-home personal care assistant to drive the 17 miles to return this in person. This is how a disabled Walmart  customer that relies on home delivery is treated - like a con artist.  Never treat yourself to something nice from these people as a Walmart   customer. They will deliver to you what they won't look you in the eye and sell you in person. Hopefully my PCA won't have to stand in the returns line at the store too long and will get back in time for me to bathe before the weekend. Disgusting.",1,1/10/2025,4.6

I paid 200 dollars for this controller just to be lied to by your company like I did something wrong I was told that because it's not the correct controller they can't accept it back even though it was sold to me by your company this is very unprofessional all I'm looking for is a replacement because I didn't make the mistake the workers did.,1,2/1/2025,4.6

410,PS5 Charging Station for Dualsense,I was recently gifted a ps5 for my birthday from my wife.

417,PS5 Charging Station for Dualsense,"Can be a bit tricky to get controllers to sit on charging stations, in the correct charging position, but that's my only issue. Probably just because my ps5 is still new and this charger is brand new and I'm honestly probably just a little overly afraid of breaking my new tech lol. Apparently it's very common, but after you figure it out it becomes natural. Charging speed is the same as using individual charging cables, one for each controller, plugged in to your PlayStation 5. Does look a lot better than cables all over and the little charger itself looks pretty cool, kinda like a little ps5. I'd recommend it. Oh, cool thing I forgot, this unit doesn't plus in to the ports like the cables with the controllers do. It actually connects to a standard power outlet",4,11/16/2024,4.8

428,The Last Of Us Part II Remastered - PlayStation 5,"TL;DR Good game but due to basically the same graphics and minimal changes I can't see it being worth it, the extras are great though!

Well as someone who played The Last Of Us Part 1 (The PlayStation 5 remaster) as there first Last Of Us experience (yes even before the Max show) and fell in love with it I was excited to play part 2, so I did so and despite my personal feelings on the story and how it was executed especially the slow pacing of the end, I still enjoyed the interactive game play. Then I saw the news about the remaster and thought I'd give it a try, still a pretty good game, and the Rougelike mode is AWESOME! But it didn't feel worth the money. If this is your first time playing the game and you have a PlayStation 5, get it, it's great! But if you already got it and don't think the Rougelike mode is worth almost 50$ I personally wouldn't get it if you're not a major fan.",4,1/21/2024,4.8
429,The Last Of Us Part II Remastered - PlayStation 5,"Let me address the elephant in the room.  How you felt about this game's story will not change, because you get the same here.  Slightly improved graphics, but since it already was one of the best-looking games to date already, even before the PS5 patch, only eagle-eyed gamers will really notice the graphical improvement.  The haptic feedback from the controller DOES enhance the experience, and there are some nice bonuses like commentary from the cast and crew.  The biggest addition is the “No Return” mode, which lets you play as pretty much any of the characters from both games, and it seems to be an apology for Naughty Dog not releasing Factions mode.  If you still have your PS4 copy, it will only cost $10 to upgrade.  Fortunately, instead of $70, it's $50 if you want to pick it up!",3,3/13/2024,4.8

454,PowerA Twin Charging Station for PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers PS5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was really excited to get my hands on this twin charging station for my PlayStation wireless controllers. This saves us so much time in between gaming sessions. I love that it charges two remotes at one time and the charging speed is really fast too. Overall this is a must have for all PlayStation lovers!,5,12/30/2023,4.8
455,PowerA Twin Charging Station for PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers PS5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this dual PS5 controller charger, it is perfect for my controllers! Since I have two it works well as storage and helps keep my controllers fully charged at all times! I would highly recommend this product it works great and looks very sleek versus a long charging cord.",5,12/27/2023,4.8
456,PowerA Twin Charging Station for PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers PS5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had already purchased a Sony branded charging station, so I was interested to see how this one compares. I don't love that the controllers face different directions, unlike the Sony one where both controllers face the same way. If they faced the same way, I'd at least be able to see if both were charging based on the lights on the Dualsense controller. This charger also feels less stable in terms of a connection between the Dualsense & the station. However, this is still a good docking station that does its job for less money compared to the Sony charging station, so I'd still recommend it to people considering a purchase.",4,12/26/2023,4.8
457,PowerA Twin Charging Station for PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers PS5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this for free in exchange for my honest review. I already have a charging station of a different brand so it helps that I can use it to compare with. 
I'll start off by saying that it is super easy to plug the controller onto the charging dock. It is also easy to remove. The only con is that there is no light indicator on the dock itself to show if it is actually charging? 
The controller only lit up initially when it was plugged in and never lit up again so I can't tell if it's charging or if my controller is actually too full to be charged anymore. 

Overall I prefer a charging station that has a light indicator so I know if it's still charging or if it's done.",3,12/20/2023,4.8

484,"Sony Playstation 5 Slim Disc Bundle with Black Pulse Headset, Extra Cobalt Blue Controller, Pro Gamer Kit, Dual Charge Dock and MightySkins Decal Voucher","...you can't utilize the Nyko controller charging base if you wrap your controller with the included PS5 Pro Gamer skin. The backing plate on the controller-installed dongle (for the lack of a better word) is unable to touch the charging contacts. It's quite clear to me that this is not a PlayStation issue. It has nothing to do with how the controllers are designed or the Pro Gamer skin is designed. This is a Nyko issue and I will try to contact support and ask if there's a way around it without having to modify or cut the Pro Gamer skin. The controllers themselves are $$$, so having the ability to add a little protection from wear and tear is an absolute must. When shelling out this much money for a combo, you expect to be able to utilize everything. Right? I'll update this review when I find out more. OTHERWISE, this is a great value.",4,11/23/2024,4.7

Digital media is my preferred option but having some physical games and movies to use means that this option is one that will be used. Sony did a great job with this option and only offering the PS5 Pro without a drive to lower costs for those who will not need one.

Overall misleading product that nobody should feel comfortable paying the same price as an actual legitimate SONY brand PS4 controller. I returned both controllers and received a full refund. I would confidently say this counterfeit controller from 3rd party manufacturers would have no value to any gamer.

655,Final Fantasy XVI - PlayStation 5,"a darker toned ff which works well for a more mature audience. they probably feel like they need more leeway like other developers such as suckerpunch, rockstar, or naughty dawg. i enjoyed my playthrough which clocked in at around 80 hours but i did all the side content which was just as memorable most of the time as the main story but the only gripe here is framerate issues on graphics mode on my base ps5. guess thats why they made the pro huh sony? lol..oh well",4,1/9/2025,4.8
656,Final Fantasy XVI - PlayStation 5,I have been playing Final Fantasy games since SNES and FF 3/6. This game is just a copy and of every other open world single player game.

658,"DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO, PlayStation 5","This game is very good but it is closer to the DB Raging Blast games than the Tenkaichi Trilogy which is not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't have the true charm that a Tenkaichi 3 has. 

Pros:
-Fun and pretty deep combat
-Vibrant and eye catching
-a bunch of returning original English voice actors (albeit noticeably older voices)

Cons:
-Character motion capture can look very weird and too human like in cutscenes with Unreal Engine
-The writing in this game isn't very good and feels lazy and can be pretty cringe at times.",5,10/28/2024,4.7

663,"DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO, PlayStation 5",I gotta get the hang of the controls but overall not bad still got to play the story a bit and get a hang on the tutorials. There's some hints of DB Raging Blast mixed in with the fast paced of Tenkaichi we know and love. The DB Super characters as a bonus. Though some characters from BT3 are missing and local co-op is limited to one stage. This is still a great game for online multilayer and plenty of single player content to keep you engaged.,4,10/21/2024,4.7
664,"DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO, PlayStation 5",The game is actually fun but the main thing that loses a star in my opinion is the Input delay in online multiplayer. It takes forever to block or after image and you can actually lose because it's not responding it works well offline but not online,4,10/29/2024,4.7
665,"DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO, PlayStation 5",received the game in the mail and it the disc was loose inside. and the plastic case was cracked and a piece was also rattling inside the case. but the game still works,3,11/22/2024,4.7

668,EA Sports College Football 25 - PlayStation 5 [Physical],"When this game first came out it was a bug-fest and very annoying to play. The potential was always there and EA has been doing a good job patching the game. It's far from perfect but I enjoy playing it more than Madden. This game should have long term playability too since unlike Madden which requires you to update every year to pretty much the same game just to keep the rosters current, this game does not need real rosters to still be fun.  This is my go to football game now.",5,10/19/2024,4.7

That is very disappointing since my time was wasted plus I had already had a confirmation of when it would get delivered.
